<h1> 9. Hypothesis testing </h1>



<blockquote>
<em>The process of induction is the process of assuming the simplest law that can be made
to harmonize with our experience. This process, however, has no logical foundation
but only a psychological one. It is clear that there are no grounds for believing that
the simplest course of events will really happen. It is an hypothesis that the sun will
rise tomorrow: and this means that we do not know whether it will rise.
</em> <br />
-   Ludwig Wittgenstein <a href="#note1">[1]</a>
