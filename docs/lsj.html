In the </span><span class="c62 c67">ANOVA</span><span class="c62">&nbsp;chapters we have added sections on repeated measures </span><span class="c62 c67">ANOVA</span><span class="c62">&nbsp;and analysis of covariance (</span><span class="c62 c67">ANCOVA</span><span class="c1 c62">). In a new chapter we have introduced Factor Analysis and related techniques. Hopefully the style of this new material is consistent with the rest of the book, though eagle-eyed readers might spot a bit more of an emphasis on conceptual and practical explanations, and a bit less algebra. I&rsquo;m not sure this is a good thing, and might add the algebra in a bit later. But it reflects both my approach to understanding and teaching statistics, and also some feedback I have received from students on a course I teach. In line with this, I have also been through the rest of the book and tried to separate out some of the algebra by putting it into a box or frame. It&rsquo;s not that this stuff is not important or useful, but for some students they may wish to skip over it and therefore the boxing of these parts should help some readers. With this version I am very grateful to comments and feedback received from my students and colleagues, notably Wakefield Morys-Carter, and also to numerous people all over the world who have sent in small suggestions and corrections - much appreciated, and keep them coming! One pretty neat new feature is that the example data files for the book can now be loaded into jamovi as an add-on module - thanks to Jonathon Love for helping with that.</span></p><p class="c53 c42"><span class="c37 c18">David Foxcroft </span></p><p class="c53 c42"><span class="c18 c67 c63">February 1st, 2019</span></p><p class="c30 c23"><span class="c1 c41"></span></p><p class="c30 c23"><span class="c1 c41"></span></p><p class="c30 c23"><span class="c1 c41"></span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c1 c18 c94">Preface to Version 0.65</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c1 c62">In this adaptation of the excellent &lsquo;Learning statistics with R&rsquo;, by Danielle Navarro, we have replaced the statistical software used for the analyses and examples with jamovi. Although R is a powerful statistical programming language, it is not the first choice for every instructor and student at the beginning of their statistical learning. Some instructors and students tend to prefer the point-and-click style of software, and that&rsquo;s where jamovi comes in. jamovi is software that aims to simplify two aspects of using R. It offers a point-and-click graphical user interface (GUI), and it also provides functions that combine the capabilities of many others, bringing a more SPSS- or SAS-like method of programming to R. Importantly, jamovi will always be free and open - that&rsquo;s one of its core values - because jamovi is made by the scientific community, for the scientific community. With this version, I am very grateful for the help of others who have read through drafts and provided excellent suggestions and corrections, particularly Dr David Emery and Kirsty Walter.</span></p><p class="c53 c42"><span class="c37 c18">David Foxcroft </span></p><p class="c53 c42"><span class="c37 c18">July 1st, 2018</span></p><p class="c53 c42 c23"><span class="c37 c18"></span></p><p class="c53 c42 c23"><span class="c37 c18"></span></p><p class="c53 c42 c23"><span class="c37 c18"></span></p><p class="c53 c42 c23"><span class="c37 c18"></span></p><p class="c53 c42 c23"><span class="c37 c18"></span></p><p class="c117 c42"><span class="c1 c18 c94">Preface to Version 0.6</span></p><p class="c42 c23 c117"><span class="c1 c18 c94"></span></p><p class="c53 c42"><span class="c1 c62">The book hasn&rsquo;t changed much since 2015 when I released Version 0.5 &ndash; it&rsquo;s probably fair to say that I&rsquo;ve changed more than it has. I moved from Adelaide to Sydney in 2016 and my teaching profile at UNSW is different to what it was at Adelaide, and I haven&rsquo;t really had a chance to work on it since arriving here! It&rsquo;s a little strange looking back at this actually. A few quick comments...</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_44-0 start"><li class="c53 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c62">Weirdly, the book consistently misgenders me, but I suppose I have only myself to blame for that one :-) There&rsquo;s now a brief footnote on page 12 that mentions this issue; in real life I&rsquo;ve been working through a gender affirmation process for the last two years and mostly go by she/her pronouns. I am, however, just as lazy as I ever was so I haven&rsquo;t bothered updating the text in the book.</span></li><li class="c53 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c62">For Version 0.6 I haven&rsquo;t changed much I&rsquo;ve made a few minor changes when people have pointed out typos or other errors. In particular</span><span class="c62">,</span><span class="c1 c62">&nbsp;it&rsquo;s worth noting the issue associated with the etaSquared function in the lsr package (which isn&rsquo;t really being maintained any more) in Section 14.4. The function works fine for the simple examples in the book, but there are bugs in there that I haven&rsquo;t found time to check! So please take care with that one.</span></li><li class="c53 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c62">The biggest change is the licensing! I&rsquo;ve released it under a Creative Commons license (CC BY-SA 4.0, specifically), and placed all the source files to the associated GitHub repository, if anyone wants to adapt it.</span></li></ul><p class="c53 c42 c23"><span class="c1 c28"></span></p><p class="c53 c42"><span class="c1 c62">Maybe someone would like to write a version that makes use of the tidyverse...

This time around, the update has focused almost entirely on the theory sections of the book. Chapters 9, 10, and 11 have been rewritten, hopefully for the better. Along the same lines, Chapter 17 is entirely new, and focuses on Bayesian statistics. I think the changes have improved the book a great deal. I&rsquo;ve always felt uncomfortable about the fact that all the inferential statistics in the book are presented from an orthodox perspective, even though I almost always present Bayesian data analyses in my own work. Now that I&rsquo;ve managed to squeeze Bayesian methods into the book somewhere, I&rsquo;m starting to feel better about the book as a whole. I wanted to get a few other things done in this update, but as usual, I&rsquo;m running into teaching deadlines, so the update has to go out the way it is!</span></p><p class="c53 c42 c23"><span class="c1 c62"></span></p><p class="c53 c42"><span class="c37 c18">Danielle Navarro </span></p><p class="c53 c42"><span class="c37 c18">February 16, 2015</span></p><p class="c53 c42 c23"><span class="c37 c18"></span></p><p class="c53 c42 c23"><span class="c37 c18"></span></p><p class="c53 c42 c23"><span class="c37 c18"></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c1 c18 c94">Preface to Version 0.4</span></p><p class="c53 c42"><span class="c1 c62">A year has gone by since I wrote the last preface. The book has changed in a few important ways: Chapters 3 and 4 do a better job of documenting some of the time saving features of RStudio, Chapters 12 and 13 now make use of new functions in the lsr package for running chi-square tests and t-tests, and the discussion of correlations has been adapted to refer to the new functions in the lsr package. The soft copy of 0.4 now has better internal referencing (i.e., actual hyperlinks between sections), though that was introduced in 0.3.1. There are a few tweaks here and there, and many typo corrections (thank you to everyone who pointed out typos!), but overall, 0.4 isn&rsquo;t massively different from 0.3.</span></p><p class="c53 c42"><span class="c1 c62">I wish I&rsquo;d had more time over the last 12 months to add more content. The absence of any discussion of repeated measures ANOVA and mixed models more generally does annoy me. My excuse for this lack of progress is that my second child was born at the start of 2013, and so I spent most of last year just trying to keep my head above water. As a consequence, unpaid side projects like this book got sidelined in favor of things that actually pay my salary! Things are a little calmer now, so with any luck version, 0.5 will be a bigger step forward.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c62">One thing that has surprised me is the number of downloads the book gets. I finally got some basic tracking information from the website a couple of months ago, and (after excluding obvious robots) the book has been averaging about 90 downloads per day. That&rsquo;s encouraging: there&rsquo;s at least a few people who find the book useful!</span></p><p class="c4 c23"><span class="c1 c62"></span></p><p class="c53 c42"><span class="c37 c18">Danielle Navarro </span></p><p class="c53 c42"><span class="c37 c18">February 4, 2014</span></p><p class="c53 c42 c23"><span class="c37 c18"></span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c1 c18 c94">Preface to Version 0.3</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c1 c62">There&rsquo;s a part of me that doesn&rsquo;t want to publish this book. It&rsquo;s not finished. And when I say that, I mean it. The referencing is spotty at best, the chapter summaries are just lists of section titles, there&rsquo;s no index, there are no exercises for the reader, the organization is suboptimal, and the coverage of topics is just not comprehensive enough for my liking. Additionally, there are sections with content that I&rsquo;m not happy with, figures that really need to be redrawn, and I&rsquo;ve had almost no time to hunt down inconsistencies, typos, or errors. In other words, this book is not finished. If I didn&rsquo;t have a looming teaching deadline and a baby due in a few weeks, I really wouldn&rsquo;t be making this available at all.</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c1 c62">What this means is that if you are an academic looking for teaching materials, a Ph.D. student looking to learn R, or just a member of the general public interested in statistics, I would advise you to be cautious. What you&rsquo;re looking at is a first draft, and it may not serve your purposes. If we were living in the days when publishing was expensive and the internet wasn&rsquo;t around, I would never consider releasing a book in this form. The thought of someone shelling out $80 for this (which is what a commercial publisher told me it would retail for when they offered to distribute it) makes me feel more than a little uncomfortable. However, it&rsquo;s the 21st century, so I can post the pdf on my website for free, and I can distribute hard copies via a print-on-demand service for less than half what a textbook publisher would charge. And so, my guilt is assuaged, and I&rsquo;m willing to share! With that in mind, you can obtain free soft copies and cheap hard copies online, from the following webpages:</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c62">Soft copy: </span><span class="c110 c62"><a class="c47" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.compcogscisydney.com/learning-statistics-with-r.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1645374859181103&amp;usg=AOvVaw24-26361YLg35jT8jj88rW">http://www.compcogscisydney.com/learning-statistics-with-r.html</a></span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c62">Hard copy: </span><span class="c110 c62"><a class="c47" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.lulu.com/content/13570633&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1645374859181476&amp;usg=AOvVaw0OkO2n3wkeHYYvxmOL7p4G">www.lulu.com/content/13570633</a></span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c62">[Ed: these links are defunct, try this instead: </span><span class="c110 c62"><a class="c47" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://learningstatisticswithr.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1645374859181787&amp;usg=AOvVaw2wy9B59cnqvF13tcHAiAaS">https://learningstatisticswithr.com/</a></span><span class="c1 c62">]</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c1 c62">Even so, the warning still stands: what you are looking at is Version 0.3 of a work in progress. If and when it hits Version 1.0, I would be willing to stand behind the work and say, yes, this is a textbook that I would encourage other people to use. At that point, I&rsquo;ll probably start shamelessly flogging the thing on the internet and generally acting like a tool. But until that day comes, I&rsquo;d like it to be made clear that I&rsquo;m ambivalent about the work as it stands.</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c1 c62">All of the above being said, there is one group of people that I can enthusiastically endorse this book to: the psychology students taking our undergraduate research methods classes (DRIP and DRIP: A) in 2013. For you, this book is ideal, because it was written to accompany your stats lectures. If a problem arises due to a shortcoming of these notes, I can and will adapt content on the fly to fix that problem. Effectively, you&rsquo;ve got a textbook written specifically for your classes, distributed for free (electronic copy) or at near-cost prices (hard copy). Better yet, the notes have been tested: Version 0.1 of these notes was used in the 2011 class, Version 0.2 was used in the 2012 class, and now you&rsquo;re looking at the new and improved Version 0.3. I&rsquo; [for a historical summary]m not saying these notes are titanium plated awesomeness on a stick &ndash; though if you wanted to say so on the student evaluation forms, then you&rsquo;re totally welcome to &ndash; because they&rsquo;re not. But I am saying that they&rsquo;ve been tried out in previous years and they seem to work okay. Besides, there&rsquo;s a group of us around to troubleshoot if any problems come up, and you can guarantee that at least one of your lecturers has read the whole thing cover to cover!</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c62">Okay, with all that out of the way, I should say something about what the book aims to be. At its core, it is an introductory statistics textbook pitched primarily at psychology students. As such, it covers the standard topics that you&rsquo;d expect of such a book: study design, descriptive statistics, the theory of hypothesis testing, t-tests, </span><img src="images/image1.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c62">tests, ANOVA and regression. However, there are also several chapters devoted to the R statistical package, including a chapter on data manipulation and another one on scripts and programming. Moreover, when you look at the content presented in the book, you&rsquo;ll notice a lot of topics that are traditionally swept under the carpet when teaching statistics to psychology students. The Bayesian/frequentist divide is openly discussed in the probability chapter, and the disagreement between Neyman and Fisher about hypothesis testing makes an appearance. The difference between probability and density is discussed. A detailed treatment of Type I, II and III sums of squares for unbalanced factorial ANOVA is provided. And if you have a look in the Epilogue, it should be clear that my intention is to add a lot more advanced content.</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c1 c62">My reasons for pursuing this approach are pretty simple: the students can handle it, and they even seem to enjoy it. Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve been pleasantly surprised at just how little difficulty I&rsquo;ve had in getting undergraduate psych students to learn R. It&rsquo;s certainly not easy for them, and I&rsquo;ve found I need to be a little charitable in setting marking standards, but they do eventually get there. Similarly, they don&rsquo;t seem to have a lot of problems tolerating ambiguity and complexity in presentation of statistical ideas, as long as they are assured that the assessment standards will be set in a fashion that is appropriate for them. So, if the students can handle it, why not teach it? The potential gains are pretty enticing. If they learn R, the students get access to CRAN, which is perhaps the largest and most comprehensive library of statistical tools in existence. And if they learn about probability theory in detail, it&rsquo;s easier for them to switch from orthodox null hypothesis testing to Bayesian methods if they want to. Better yet, they learn data analysis skills that they can take to an employer without being dependent on expensive and proprietary software.</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c1 c62">Sadly, this book isn&rsquo;t the silver bullet that makes all this possible. It&rsquo;s a work in progress, and maybe when it is finished it will be a useful tool. One among many, I would think. Several other books try to provide a basic introduction to statistics using R, and I&rsquo;m not arrogant enough to believe that mine is better. Still, I rather like the book, and maybe other people will find it useful, incomplete though it is.</span></p><p class="c53 c42"><span class="c37 c18">Danielle Navarro </span></p><p class="c53 c42"><span class="c37 c18">January 13, 2013</span></p><p class="c66 c42 c23"><span class="c1 c62"></span></p><p class="c30 c23"><span class="c1 c41"></span></p><p class="c30 c23"><span class="c1 c41"></span></p><p class="c30 c23 title"><span class="c1 c85"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c17 title"><span class="c58 c98 c45">Background</span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><ol class="c14 lst-kix_list_40-0 start" start="1"><li class="c42 c22 c91 li-bullet-0"><h1 style="display:inline"><span class="c65 c127">Why do we learn statistics?</span></h1></li></ol><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c62 c67 c55">&ldquo;Thou shalt not answer questionnaires or quizzes upon World Affairs, nor with compliance Take any test.

To the surprise of no-one, statistics is very rarely the favorite part of one&rsquo;s psychological education. After all, if you really loved the idea of doing statistics, you&rsquo;d probably be enrolled in a statistics class right now, not a psychology class. So, not surprisingly, there&rsquo;s a pretty large proportion of the student base that isn&rsquo;t happy about the fact that psychology has so much statistics in it. In view of this, I thought that the right place to start might be to answer some of the more common questions that people have about stats.</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c51 c52">A big part of this issue at hand relates to the very idea of statistics. What is it? What&rsquo;s it there for? And why are scientists so bloody obsessed with it? These are all good questions, when you think about it. So, let&rsquo;s start with the last one. As a group, scientists seem to be bizarrely fixated on running statistical tests on everything. In fact, we use statistics so often that we sometimes forget to explain to people why we do. It&rsquo;s a kind of article of faith among scientists &ndash; and especially social scientists &ndash; that your findings can&rsquo;t be trusted until you&rsquo;ve done some stats. Undergraduate students might be forgiven for thinking that we&rsquo;re all completely mad, because no-one takes the time to answer one very simple question:</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c10 c88">Why do you do statistics? Why don&rsquo;t scientists just use </span><span class="c10 c88 c139">common sense</span><span class="c51 c10">?</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s a naive question in some ways, but most good questions are. There&rsquo;s a lot of good answers to i</span><span>t</span><img src="images/image3.png"><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;but for my money, the best answer is a really simple one: we don&rsquo;t trust ourselves enough. We worry that we&rsquo;re human, and susceptible to all of the biases, temptations and frailties that humans suffer from. </span><hr></p><p class="c19"><img src="images/image2.png"><span>&nbsp;The quote comes from Auden&rsquo;s 1946 poem Under Which Lyre: A Reactionary Tract for the Times, delivered as part of a commencement address at Harvard University. The history of the poem is kind of interesting: </span><span class="c52 c70 c7">http://harvardmagazine.com/2007/11/a-poets-warning.html</span></p><p class="c19"><img src="images/image3.png"><span>&nbsp;Including the suggestion that common sense is in short supply among scientists.</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Much of statistics is basically a safeguard. Using &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; to evaluate evidence means trusting gut instincts, relying on verbal arguments and on using the raw power of human reason to come up with the right answer. Most scientists don&rsquo;t think this approach is likely to work.</span></p><p class="c42 c114"><span class="c51 c52">In fact, come to think of it, this sounds a lot like a psychological question to me, and since I do work in a psychology department, it seems like a good idea to dig a little deeper here. Is it really plausible to think that this &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; approach is very trustworthy? Verbal arguments have to be constructed in language, and all languages have biases &ndash; some things are harder to say than others, and not necessarily because they&rsquo;re false (e.g., quantum electrodynamics is a good theory, but hard to explain in words). The instincts of our &ldquo;gut&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t designed to solve scientific problems, they&rsquo;re designed to handle day to day inferences &ndash; and given that biological evolution is slower than cultural change, we should say that they&rsquo;re designed to solve the day-to-day problems for a different world than the one we live in. Most fundamentally, reasoning sensibly requires people to engage in &ldquo;induction&rdquo;, making wise guesses and going beyond the immediate evidence of the senses to make generalizations about the world. If you think that you can do that without being influenced by various distractors, well, I have a bridge in London I&rsquo;d like to sell you. Heck, as the next section shows, we can&rsquo;t even solve &ldquo;deductive&rdquo; problems (ones where no guessing is required) without being influenced by our pre-existing biases.</span></p><h3 class="c42 c125"><span class="c31">1.1.1</span><span class="c65">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c31">The curse of belief bias</span></h3><p class="c42 c56"><span class="c0">People are mostly pretty smart. We&rsquo;re certainly smarter than the other species that we share the planet with (though many people might disagree). Our minds are quite amazing things, and we seem to be capable of the most incredible feats of thought and reason. That doesn&rsquo;t make us perfect though. And among the many things that psychologists have shown over the years is that we really do find it hard to be neutral, to evaluate evidence impartially and without being swayed by pre-existing biases. A good example of this is the </span><span class="c38">belief bias effect</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;in logical reasoning: if you ask people to decide whether a particular argument is logically valid (i.e., conclusion would be true if the premises were true), we tend to be influenced by the believability of the conclusion, even when we shouldn&rsquo;t. For instance, here&rsquo;s a valid argument where the conclusion is believable:</span></p><p class="c35 c42 c40"><span class="c51 c52">All cigarettes are expensive (Premise 1)</span></p><p class="c35 c42 c40"><span class="c51 c52">Some addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 2)</span></p><p class="c77 c42 c40"><span class="c0">Therefore, some addictive things are not cigarettes (Conclusion)</span></p><p class="c42 c138"><span class="c51 c52">And here&rsquo;s a valid argument where the conclusion is not believable:</span></p><p class="c35 c42 c40"><span class="c51 c52">All addictive things are expensive (Premise 1)</span></p><p class="c35 c40 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Some cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 2)</span></p><p class="c42 c40 c77"><span class="c51 c52">Therefore, some cigarettes are not addictive (Conclusion)</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">The logical structure of argument #2 is identical to the structure of argument #1, and they&rsquo;re both valid. However, in the second argument, there are good reasons to think that premise 1 is incorrect, and as a result it&rsquo;s probably the case that the conclusion is also incorrect. But that&rsquo;s entirely irrelevant to the topic at hand; an argument is deductively valid if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises. That is, a valid argument doesn&rsquo;t have to involve true statements.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">On the other hand, here&rsquo;s an invalid argument that has a believable conclusion:</span></p><p class="c42 c40 c44"><span class="c51 c52">All addictive things are expensive (Premise 1) </span></p><p class="c44 c42 c40"><span class="c51 c52">Some cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 2) </span></p><p class="c44 c42 c40"><span class="c51 c52">Therefore, some addictive things are not cigarettes (Conclusion)</span></p><p class="c17 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c51 c52">And finally, an invalid argument with an unbelievable conclusion:</span></p><p class="c35 c42 c40"><span class="c51 c52">All cigarettes are expensive (Premise 1) </span></p><p class="c35 c42 c40"><span class="c51 c52">Some addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 2) </span></p><p class="c77 c42 c40"><span class="c51 c52">Therefore, some cigarettes are not addictive (Conclusion)</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Now, suppose that people really are perfectly able to set aside their pre-existing biases about what is true and what isn&rsquo;t, and purely evaluate an argument on its logical merits. We&rsquo;d expect 100% of people to say that the valid arguments are valid, and 0% of people to say that the invalid arguments are valid. So, if you ran an experiment looking at this, you&rsquo;d expect to see data like this:</span></p><a id="t.1dd0fe676ecf185cd48065e4dcd47cd3435a9fd7"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c87"><tbody><tr class="c11"><td class="c113" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c35 c42 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p></td><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">conclusion feels true</span></p></td><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c1 c0">conclusion feels false</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">argument is valid</span></p></td><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">100% say &ldquo;valid&rdquo;</span></p></td><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c1 c0">100% say &ldquo;valid&rdquo;</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">argument is invalid</span></p></td><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">0% say &ldquo;valid&rdquo;</span></p></td><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">0% say &ldquo;valid&rdquo;</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c19 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c56 c42"><span class="c51 c52">If the psychological data looked like this (or even a good approximation to this), we might feel safe in just trusting our gut instincts.

Even so, if you were a professional &ldquo;evaluator of evidence&rdquo;, and someone came along and offered you a magic tool that improves your chances of making the right decision from 60% to (say) 95%, you&rsquo;d probably jump at it, right? Of course, you would. Thankfully, we actually do have a tool that can do this. But it&rsquo;s not magic, it&rsquo;s statistics. So that&rsquo;s reason #1 why scientists love statistics. It&rsquo;s just too easy for us to &ldquo;believe what we want to believe&rdquo;. So instead, if we want to &ldquo;believe in the data&rdquo;, we&rsquo;re going to need a bit of help to keep our personal biases under control.

How can both of these statements be true at the same time?</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on. Firstly, notice that the departments are not equal to one another in terms of their admission percentages: some departments (e.g., A, B) tended to admit a high percentage of the qualified applicants, whereas others (e.g., F) tended to reject most of the candidates, even if they were high quality. So, among the six departments shown above, notice that department A is the most generous, followed by B, C, D, E and F in that order. Next, notice that males and females tended to apply to different departments. If we rank the departments in terms of the total number of male applicants, we get </span><span class="c88 c65">A</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image6.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c88 c65">B </span><img src="images/image6.png"><span class="c88 c65">&nbsp;</span><span>D </span><img src="images/image6.png"><span>&nbsp;C </span><img src="images/image6.png"><span class="c65">&nbsp;</span><span>F </span><img src="images/image6.png"><span>&nbsp;E </span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(the &ldquo;easy&rdquo; departments are in bold). On the whole, males tended to apply to the departments that had high admission rates. Now compare this to how the female applicants distributed themselves. Ranking the departments in terms of the total number of female applicants produces a quite different ordering</span><span>&nbsp;C </span><img src="images/image6.png"><span>&nbsp;E </span><img src="images/image6.png"><span>&nbsp;D </span><img src="images/image6.png"><span>&nbsp;F </span><img src="images/image6.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c65">A </span><img src="images/image6.png"><span class="c65">&nbsp;B</span><span class="c0">. In other words, what these data seem to be suggesting is that the female applicants tended to apply to &ldquo;harder&rdquo; departments. And in fact, if we look at Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">1.1</span><span class="c0">, we see that this trend is systematic, and quite striking. This effect is known as </span><span class="c38">Simpson&rsquo;s paradox</span><span class="c51 c52">. It&rsquo;s not common, but it does happen in real life, and most people are very surprised by it when they first encounter it, and many people refuse to even believe that it&rsquo;s real. It is very real. And while there are lots of very subtle statistical lessons buried in there, I want to use it to make a much more important point: doing research is hard, and there are lots of subtle, counter-intuitive traps lying in wait for the unwary. That&rsquo;s reason #2 why scientists love statistics, and why we teach research methods. Because science is hard, and the truth is sometimes cunningly hidden in the nooks and crannies of complicated data.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Before leaving this topic entirely, I want to point out something else really critical that is often overlooked in a research methods class. Statistics only solves part of the problem. Remember that we started all this with the concern that Berkeley&rsquo;s admissions processes might be unfairly biased against female applicants. When we looked at the &ldquo;aggregated&rdquo; data, it did seem like </span><span class="c51 c52">the university was discriminating against women, but when we &ldquo;disaggregate&rdquo; and looked at the individual behavior of all the departments, it turned out that the actual departments were, if anything, slightly biased in favor of women. The gender bias in total admissions was caused by the fact that women tended to self-select for harder departments. From a legal perspective, that would probably put the university in the clear.</span></p><hr><p class="c6"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c57 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 415.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image300.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 415.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Figure 1.1: The Berkeley 1973 college admissions data. This figure plots the admission rate for the 85 departments that had at least one female applicant, as a function of the percentage of applicants that were female. The plot is a redrawing of Figure 1 from </span><span class="c0 c45">Bickel, Hammel, and O&rsquo;Connell (1975)</span><span class="c0">. Circles plot departments with more than 40 applicants; the area of the circle is proportional to the total number of applicants. The crosses plot departments with fewer than 40 applicants.</span></p><hr><p class="c6"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">Postgraduate admissions are determined at the level of the individual department, and there are good reasons to do that. At the level of individual departments, the decisions are more or less unbiased (the weak bias in favor of females at that level is small, and not consistent across departments). Since the university can&rsquo;t dictate which departments people choose to apply to, and the decision making takes place at the level of the department it can hardly be held accountable for any biases that those choices produce.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">That was the basis for my somewhat glib remarks earlier, but that&rsquo;s not exactly the whole story, is it? After all, if we&rsquo;re interested in this from a more sociological and psychological perspective, we might want to ask why there are such strong gender differences in applications. Why do males tend to apply to engineering more often than females, and why is this reversed for the English department? And why is it the case that the departments that tend to have a female-application bias tend to have lower overall admission rates than those departments that have a male-application bias? Might this not still reflect a gender bias, even though every single department is itself unbiased? It might. Suppose, hypothetically, that males preferred to apply to &ldquo;hard sciences&rdquo; and females prefer &ldquo;humanities&rdquo;. And suppose further that the reason for why the humanities departments have low admission rates is because the government doesn&rsquo;t want to fund the humanities (Ph.D. places, for instance, are often tied to government funded research projects). Does that constitute a gender bias? Or just an unenlightened view of the value of the humanities? What if someone at a high level in the government cut the humanities funds because they felt that the humanities are &ldquo;useless chick stuff&rdquo;. That seems pretty blatantly gender biased. None of this fall within the purview of statistics, but it matters to the research project. If you&rsquo;re interested in the overall structural effects of subtle gender biases, then you probably want to look at both the aggregated and disaggregated data. If you&rsquo;re interested in the decision-making process at Berkeley itself then you&rsquo;re probably only interested in the disaggregated data.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">In short there are a lot of critical questions that you can&rsquo;t answer with statistics, but the answers to those questions will have a huge impact on how you analyze and interpret data. And this is the reason why you should always think of statistics as a tool to help you learn about your data. No more and no less. It&rsquo;s a powerful tool to that end, but there&rsquo;s no substitute for careful thought.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c31">1.3</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Statistics in psychology</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">I hope that the discussion above helped explain why science in general is so focused on statistics. But I&rsquo;m guessing that you have a lot more questions about what role statistics plays in psychology, and specifically why psychology classes always devote so many lectures to stats. So, here&rsquo;s my attempt to answer a few of them...</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_37-0 start"><li class="c15 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c58">Why does psychology have so much statistics?</span></li></ul><p class="c15 c40"><span class="c0">To be perfectly honest, there&rsquo;s a few different reasons, some of which are better than others. The most important reason is that psychology is a statistical science. What I mean by that is that the &ldquo;things&rdquo; that we study are people. Real, complicated, gloriously messy, infuriatingly perverse people. The &ldquo;things&rdquo; of physics include objects like electrons, and while there are all sorts of complexities that arise in physics, electrons don&rsquo;t have minds of their own. They don&rsquo;t have opinions, they don&rsquo;t differ from each other in weird and arbitrary ways, they don&rsquo;t get bored in the middle of an experiment, and they don&rsquo;t get angry at the experimenter and then deliberately try to sabotage the data set (not that I&rsquo;ve ever done that!). At a fundamental level psychology is harder than physics.</span><span class="c71">5</span></p><hr><p class="c6 c40"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c15 c40"><img src="images/image7.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Which might explain why physics is just a teensy bit further advanced as a science than we are.</span></p><p class="c15 c40"><span>Basically, we teach statistics to you as psychologists because you need to be better at stats than physicists. There&rsquo;s actually a saying used sometimes in physics, to the effect that &ldquo;if your experiment needs statistics, you should have done a better experiment&rdquo;. </span><span class="c51 c52">They have the luxury of being able to say that because their objects of study are pathetically simple in comparison to the vast mess that confronts social scientists. And it&rsquo;s not just psychology. Most social sciences are desperately reliant on statistics. Not because we&rsquo;re bad experimenters, but because we&rsquo;ve picked a harder problem to solve. We teach you stats because you really, really need it.</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_36-0 start"><li class="c15 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c58">Can&rsquo;t someone else do the statistics?</span></li></ul><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">To some extent, but not completely. It&rsquo;s true that you don&rsquo;t need to become a fully trained statistician just to do psychology, but you do need to reach a certain level of statistical competence. In my view, there&rsquo;s three reasons that every psychological researcher ought to be able to do basic statistics:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_35-0 start"><li class="c53 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Firstly, there&rsquo;s the fundamental reason: statistics is deeply intertwined with research design. If you want to be good at designing psychological studies, you need to at the very least understand the basics of stats.</span></li><li class="c53 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Secondly, if you want to be good at the psychological side of the research, then you need to be able to understand the psychological literature, right? But almost every paper in the psychological literature reports the results of statistical analyses. So, if you really want to understand the psychology, you need to be able to understand what other people did with their data. And that means understanding a certain amount of statistics.</span></li><li class="c15 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Thirdly, there&rsquo;s a big practical problem with being dependent on other people to do all your statistics: statistical analysis is expensive. If you ever get bored and want to look up how much the Australian government charges for university fees, you&rsquo;ll notice something interesting: statistics is designated as a &ldquo;national priority&rdquo; category, and so the fees are much, much lower than for any other area of study. This is because there&rsquo;s a massive shortage of statisticians out there. So, from your perspective as a psychological researcher, the laws of supply and demand aren&rsquo;t exactly on your side here! As a result, in almost any real-life situation where you want to do psychological research, the cruel facts will be that you don&rsquo;t have enough money to afford a statistician. So, the economics of the situation mean that you have to be pretty self-sufficient.</span></li></ul><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">Note that a lot of these reasons generalize beyond researchers. If you want to be a practicing psychologist and stay on top of the field, it helps to be able to read the scientific literature, which relies pretty heavily on statistics.</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_34-0 start"><li class="c15 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c58">I don&rsquo;t care about jobs, research, or clinical work. Do I need statistics?</span></li></ul><p class="c15 c40"><span class="c0">Okay, now you&rsquo;re just messing with me. Still, I think it should matter to you too. Statistics should matter to you in the same way that statistics should matter to everyone. We live in the 21st century, and data are </span><span class="c76 c88">everywhere</span><span class="c51 c52">. Frankly, given the world in which we live these days, a basic knowledge of statistics is pretty damn close to a survival tool! Which is the topic of the next section.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c31">1.4</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Statistics in everyday life</span></p><p class="c48 c42"><span class="c1 c62">&ldquo;We are drowning in information, but we are starved for knowledge&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c48 c42"><span class="c1 c62">Various authors, original probably John Naisbitt</span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c1 c62"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">When I started writing up my lecture notes I took the 20 most recent news articles posted to the ABC news website. Of those 20 articles, it turned out that 8 of them involved a discussion of something that I would call a statistical topic and 6 of those made a mistake. The most common error, if you&rsquo;re curious, was failing to report baseline data (e.g., the article mentions that 5% of people in situation X have some characteristic Y, but doesn&rsquo;t say how common the characteristic is for everyone else!). The point I&rsquo;m trying to make here isn&rsquo;t that journalists are bad at statistics (though they almost always are), it&rsquo;s that a basic knowledge of statistics is very helpful for trying to figure out when someone else is either making a mistake or even lying to you. In fact, one of the biggest things that a knowledge of statistics does to you is cause you to get angry at the newspaper or the internet on a far more frequent basis. You can find a good example of this in Section </span><span class="c0 c45">4.1.5.</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;In later versions of this book, I&rsquo;ll try to include more anecdotes along those lines.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c31">1.5</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">There&rsquo;s more to research methods than statistics</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">So far, most of what I&rsquo;ve talked about is statistics, and so you&rsquo;d be forgiven for thinking that statistics is all I care about in life. To be fair, you wouldn&rsquo;t be far wrong, but research methodology is a broader concept than statistics. So, most research methods courses will cover a lot of topics that relate much more to the pragmatics of research design, and in particular the issues that you encounter when trying to do research with humans. However, about 99% of student fears relate to the statistics part of the course, so I&rsquo;ve focused on the stats in this discussion, and hopefully I&rsquo;ve convinced you that statistics matters, and more importantly, that it&rsquo;s not to be feared. That being said, it&rsquo;s pretty typical for introductory research methods classes to be very stats-heavy. This is not (usually) because the lecturers are evil people. Quite the contrary, in fact. Introductory classes focus a lot on the statistics because you almost always find yourself needing statistics before you need the other research methods training. Why? Because almost all of your assignments in other classes will rely on statistical training, to a much greater extent than they rely on other methodological tools. It&rsquo;s not common for undergraduate assignments to require you to design your own study from the ground up (in which case you would need to know a lot about research design), but it is common for assignments to ask you to analyze and interpret data that were collected in a study that someone else designed (in which case you need statistics). In that sense, from the perspective of allowing you to do well in all your other classes, the statistics is more urgent.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">But note that &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; is different from &ldquo;important&rdquo; &ndash; they both matter. I really do want to stress that research design is just as important as data analysis, and this book does spend a fair amount of time on it. However, while statistics has a kind of universality, and provides a set of core tools that are useful for most types of psychological research, the research methods side isn&rsquo;t quite so universal. There are some general principles that everyone should think about, but a lot of research design is very idiosyncratic, and is specific to the area of research that you want to engage in. To the extent that it&rsquo;s the details that matter, those details don&rsquo;t usually show up in an introductory stats and research methods class.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><h2 class="c72 c42"><span class="c58 c96 c126"></span></h2><h2 class="c72 c42"><span class="c1 c93 c65"></span></h2><h2 class="c72 c42"><span class="c1 c65 c93"></span></h2><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c0 c1"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><h2 class="c42 c72"><span class="c1 c93 c65"></span></h2><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><h1 class="c91 c42"><span class="c65 c45">2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c24">A brief introduction to research design</span></h1><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c48 c42"><span class="c37 c76">To consult the statistician after an experiment is finished is often merely to ask him to conduct a post mortem examination.

Firstly, it&rsquo;s much more psychology specific than the later chapters. Secondly, it focuses much more heavily on the scientific problem of research methodology, and much less on the statistical problem of data analysis.

But I want to point out that even in the case of someone&rsquo;s age it&rsquo;s much more subtle than this. For instance, in the example above I assumed that it was okay to measure age in years. But if you&rsquo;re a developmental psychologist, that&rsquo;s way too crude, and so you often measure age in </span><span class="c10 c88">years and months</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;(if a child is 2 years and 11 months this is usually written as &ldquo;2;11&rdquo;). If you&rsquo;re interested in newborns you might want to measure age in days since birth, maybe even hours since birth. In other words, the way in which you specify the allowable measurement values is important.</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c51 c52">Looking at this a bit more closely, you might also realize that the concept of &ldquo;age&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t actually all that precise. In general, when we say &ldquo;age&rdquo; we implicitly mean &ldquo;the length of time since birth&rdquo;. But that&rsquo;s not always the right way to do it. Suppose you&rsquo;re interested in how newborn babies control their eye movements. If you&rsquo;re interested in kids that young, you might also start to worry that &ldquo;birth&rdquo; is not the only meaningful point in time to care about. If Baby Alice is born 3 weeks premature and Baby Bianca is born 1 week late, would it really make sense to say that they are the &ldquo;same age&rdquo; if we encountered them &ldquo;2 hours after birth&rdquo;? In one sense, yes. By social convention we use birth as our reference point for talking about age in everyday life, since it defines the amount of time the person has been operating as an independent entity in the world. But from a scientific perspective that&rsquo;s not the only thing we care about. When we think about the biology of human beings, it&rsquo;s often useful to think of ourselves as organisms that have been growing and maturing since conception, and from that perspective Alice and Bianca aren&rsquo;t the same age at all. So, you might want to define the concept of &ldquo;age&rdquo; in two different ways: the length of time since conception and the length of time since birth. When dealing with adults it won&rsquo;t make much difference, but when dealing with newborns it might.</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c0">Moving beyond these issues, there&rsquo;s the question of methodology. What specific &ldquo;measurement method&rdquo; are you going to use to find out someone&rsquo;s age? As before, there are lots of different possibilities:</span></p><hr><p class="c17 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c17"><img src="images/image3.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c79">Well... now this is awkward, isn&rsquo;t it? This section is one of the oldest parts of the book, and it&rsquo;s outdated in a rather embarrassing way. I wrote this in 2010, at which point all of those facts were true. Revisiting this in 2018, well I&rsquo;m not 33 any more, but that&rsquo;s not surprising I suppose. I can&rsquo;t imagine my chromosomes have changed, so I&rsquo;m going to guess my karyotype was then and is now XY. The self-identified gender, on the other hand...ah. I suppose the fact that the title page now refers to me as Danielle rather than Daniel might possibly be a giveaway, but I don&rsquo;t typically identify as &ldquo;male&rdquo; on a gender questionnaire these days, and I prefer &ldquo;she/her&rdquo; pronouns as a default (it&rsquo;s a long story)! I did think a little about how I was going to handle this in the book, actually. The</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c79">book has a</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c34">somewhat distinct authorial voice to it, and I feel like it would be a rather different work if I went back and wrote everything as Danielle and updated all the pronouns in the work. Besides, it would be a lot of work, so I&rsquo;ve left my name as &ldquo;Dan&rdquo; throughout the book, and in any case &ldquo;Dan&rdquo; is a perfectly good nickname for &ldquo;Danielle&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t you think? In any case, it&rsquo;s not a big deal. I only wanted to mention it to make life a little easier for readers who aren&rsquo;t sure how to refer to me. I still don&rsquo;t like anchovies though :-) </span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_31-0 start"><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">You could just ask people &ldquo;how old are you?&rdquo; The method of self-report is fast, cheap and easy.

It doesn&rsquo;t work as well if you want to know &ldquo;age since conception&rdquo;, since a lot of parents can&rsquo;t say for sure when conception took place. For that, you might need a different authority (e.g., an obstetrician).</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span>You could look up official records, for example birth or death certificates. This is a time consuming and frustrating endeavor, but it has its uses (e.g., if the person is now dead).</span></li></ul><p class="c17 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><h3 class="c42 c121"><span class="c86 c55">2.1.2</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c28">Operationalization: defining your measurement</span></h3><p class="c17"><span class="c1 c28">All of the ideas discussed in the previous section relate to the concept of operationalization. To be a bit more precise about the idea, operationalization is the process by which we take a meaningful but somewhat vague concept and turn it into a precise measurement. The process of operationalization can involve several different things:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_30-0 start"><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Being precise about what you are trying to measure. For instance, does &ldquo;age&rdquo; mean &ldquo;time since birth&rdquo; or &ldquo;time since conception&rdquo; in the context of your research?</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Determining what method, you will use to measure it. Will you use self-report to measure age, ask a parent, or look up an official record? If you&rsquo;re using self-report, how will you phrase the question?</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Defining the set of allowable values that the measurement can take. Note that these values don&rsquo;t always have to be numerical, though they often are. When measuring age, the values are numerical, but we still need to think carefully about what numbers are allowed. Do we want age in years, years and months, days, or hours? For other types of measurements (e.g., gender) the values aren&rsquo;t numerical. But, just as before, we need to think about what values are allowed. If we&rsquo;re asking people to self-report their gender, what options to we allow them to choose between? Is it enough to allow only &ldquo;male&rdquo; or &ldquo;female&rdquo;? Do you need another option? Or should we not give people specific options and instead let them answer in their own words? And if you open up the set of possible values to include all verbal response, how will you interpret their answers?</span></li></ul><p class="c17"><span class="c51 c52">Operationalization is a tricky business, and there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;one, true way&rdquo; to do it. The way in which you choose to operationalize the informal concept of &ldquo;age&rdquo; or &ldquo;gender&rdquo; into a formal measurement depends on what you need to use the measurement for. Often, you&rsquo;ll find that the community of scientists who work in your area have some fairly well-established ideas for how to go about it. In other words, operationalization needs to be thought through on a case-by-case basis. Nevertheless, while there a lot of issues that are specific to each individual research project, there are some aspects to it that are pretty general.</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c51 c52">Before moving on I want to take a moment to clear up our terminology, and in the process introduce one more term. Here are four different things that are closely related to each other:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_29-0 start"><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c50 c13">A theoretical construct</span><span class="c52 c70 c102">.</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;This is the thing that you&rsquo;re trying to take a measurement of, like &ldquo;age&rdquo;, &ldquo;gender&rdquo; or an &ldquo;opinion&rdquo;. A theoretical construct can&rsquo;t be directly observed, and often they&rsquo;re actually a bit vague.</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c50 c13">A measure.</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;The measure refers to the method or the tool that you use to make your observations. A question in a survey, a behavioral observation or a brain scan could all count as a measure.</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c50 c13">An operationalization.</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;The term &ldquo;operationalization&rdquo; refers to the logical connection between the measure and the theoretical construct, or to the process by which we try to derive a measure from a theoretical construct.</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c50 c13">A variable.</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Finally, a new term. A variable is what we end up with when we apply our measure to something in the world. That is, variables are the actual &ldquo;data&rdquo; that we end up with in our data sets.</span></li></ul><p class="c17"><span class="c51 c52">In practice, even scientists tend to blur the distinction between these things, but it&rsquo;s very helpful to try to understand the differences.</span></p><p class="c17 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c31">2.2</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Scales of measurements</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c0">As the previous section indicates, the outcome of a psychological measurement is called a variable. But not all variables are of the same qualitative type and so it&rsquo;s useful to understand what types there are. A very useful concept for distinguishing between different types of variables is what&rsquo;s known as </span><span class="c58 c70 c102">scales of measurement.</span></p><h3 class="c42 c135"><span class="c86 c55">2.2.1</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c28">Nominal scale</span></h3><p class="c33"><span class="c28">A </span><span class="c21">nominal scale</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;variable (also referred to as a </span><span class="c21">categorical</span><span class="c1 c28">&nbsp;variable) is one in which there is no particular relationship between the different possibilities. For these kinds of variables, it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to say that one of them is &ldquo;bigger&rsquo; or &ldquo;better&rdquo; than any other one, and it absolutely doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to average them. The classic example for this is &ldquo;eye color&rdquo;. Eyes can be blue, green or brown, amongst other possibilities, but none of them is any &ldquo;bigger&rdquo; than any other one. As a result, it would feel really weird to talk about an &ldquo;average eye color&rdquo;. Similarly, gender is nominal too: male isn&rsquo;t better or worse than female. Neither does it make sense to try to talk about an &ldquo;average gender&rdquo;. In short, nominal scale variables are those for which the only thing you can say about the different possibilities is that they are different. That&rsquo;s it.</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c1 c28">Let&rsquo;s take a slightly closer look at this. Suppose I was doing research on how people commute to and from work. One variable I would have to measure would be what kind of transportation people use to get to work. This &ldquo;transport type&rdquo; variable could have quite a few possible values, including: &ldquo;train&rdquo;, &ldquo;bus&rdquo;, &ldquo;car&rdquo;, &ldquo;bicycle&rdquo;. For now, let&rsquo;s suppose that these four are the only possibilities. Then imagine that I ask 100 people how they got to work today, with this result:</span></p><p class="c17 c23"><span class="c1 c28"></span></p><p class="c17 c23"><span class="c1 c28"></span></p><a id="t.dbe7b9021d2607797f62fa75dd984e49f30457b3"></a><a id="t.5"></a><table class="c87"><tbody><tr class="c11"><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c1 c28">Transportation</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c1 c28">Number of people</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c1 c28">(1) Train</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c1 c28">12</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c1 c28">(2) Bus</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c1 c28">30</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c1 c28">(3) Car</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c1 c28">48</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c1 c28">(4) Bicycle</span></p></td><td class="c2" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c1 c28">10</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c1 c28"></span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c1 c28">So, what&rsquo;s the average transportation type?

An ordinal scale variable is one in which there is a natural, meaningful way to order the different possibilities, but you can&rsquo;t do anything else.

You </span><span class="c10">can</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;say that the person who finished first was faster than the person who finished second, but you don&rsquo;t know how much faster. As a consequence, we know that 1st &gt; 2nd, and we know that 2nd &gt; 3rd, but the difference between 1st and 2nd might be much larger than the difference between 2nd and 3rd.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">Here&rsquo;s a more psychologically interesting example. Suppose I&rsquo;m interested in people&rsquo;s attitudes to climate change.

Statement 1 is a close match, statement 2 is a reasonable match, statement 3 isn&rsquo;t a very good match, and statement 4 is in strong opposition to current science. So, in terms of the thing I&rsquo;m interested in (the extent to which people endorse the science), I can order the items as 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4.

And it&rsquo;s also quite reasonable to group (2), (3) and (4) together and say that 49 out of 100 people registered </span><span class="c10">at least some disagreement</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;with the dominant scientific view. However, it would be entirely bizarre to try to group (1), (2) and (4) together and say that 90 out of 100 people said. . . what? There&rsquo;s nothing sensible that allows you to group those responses together at all.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">That said, notice that while we can use the natural ordering of these items to construct sensible groupings, what we can&rsquo;t do is average them. For instance, in my simple example here, the &ldquo;average&rdquo; response to the question is 1.97. If you can tell me what that means I&rsquo;d love to know, because it seems like gibberish to me!</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">2.2.3</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c28">Interval scale</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c86">In contrast to nominal and ordinal scale variables, </span><span class="c65 c84">interval scale</span><span class="c86">&nbsp;and ratio scale variables are variables for which the numerical value is genuinely meaningful. In the case of interval scale variables, the differences between the numbers are interpretable, but the variable doesn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; zero value. A good example of an interval scale variable is measuring temperature in degrees celsius. For instance, if it was 15&deg; yesterday and 18&deg; today, then the 3&deg; difference between the two is genuinely meaningful. Moreover, that 3</span><span>&deg;</span><span class="c86">&nbsp;difference is exactly the same as the 3&deg; difference between 7&deg; and 10&deg;. In short, addition and subtraction are meaningful for interval scale variables</span><span class="c71">3</span><span class="c51 c52">.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c1 c28">However, notice that the 0&deg; does not mean &ldquo;no temperature at all&rdquo;. It actually means &ldquo;the temperature at which water freezes&rdquo;, which is pretty arbitrary. As a consequence, it becomes pointless to try to multiply and divide temperatures. It is wrong to say that 20&deg; is twice as hot as 10&deg;, just as it is weird and meaningless to try to claim that 20&deg; is negative two times as hot as -10&deg;.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c1 c28">Again, let&#39;s look at a more psychological example. Suppose I&rsquo;m interested in looking at how the attitudes of first-year university students have changed over time. Obviously, I&rsquo;m going to want to record the year in which each student started. This is an interval scale variable. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c28"></span></p><hr><p class="c6"><span class="c1 c28"></span></p><p class="c15"><img src="images/image4.png"><span class="c51 c52">Actually, I&rsquo;ve been informed by readers with greater physics knowledge than I that temperature isn&rsquo;t strictly an interval scale, in the sense that the amount of energy required to heat something up by 3&#733; depends on it&rsquo;s current temperature. So in the sense that physicists care about, temperature isn&rsquo;t actually an interval scale. But it still makes a cute example so I&rsquo;m going to ignore this inconvenient truth.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c1 c28">A student who started in 2003 did arrive 5 years before a student who started in 2008. However, it would be completely daft for me to divide 2008 by 2003 and say that the second student started &ldquo;1.0024 times later&rdquo; than the first one. That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense at all.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">2.2.4</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c28 c55">Ratio scale</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c28">The fourth and final type of variable to consider is a ratio </span><span class="c21">scale variable</span><span class="c1 c28">, in which zero really means zero, and it&rsquo;s okay to multiply and divide. A good psychological example of a ratio scale variable is response time (RT). In a lot of tasks, it&rsquo;s very common to record the amount of time somebody takes to solve a problem or answer a question, because it&rsquo;s an indicator of how difficult the task is. Suppose that Alan takes 2.3 seconds to respond to a question, whereas Ben takes 3.1 seconds. As with an interval scale variable, addition and subtraction are both meaningful here. Ben really did take 3.1 -2.3 =0.8 seconds longer than Alan did. However, notice that multiplication and division also make sense here too: Ben took 3.1/2.3 = 1.35 times as long as Alan did to answer the question. And the reason why you can do this is that for a ratio scale variable such as RT &ldquo;zero seconds&rdquo; really does mean &ldquo;no time at all&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">2.2.5</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c28 c55">Continuous versus discrete variables</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c1 c28">There&rsquo;s a second kind of distinction that you need to be aware of, regarding what types of variables you can run into.

For instance, response time is continuous. If Alan takes 3.1 seconds and Ben takes 2.3 seconds to respond to a question, then Cameron&rsquo;s response time will lie in between if he took 3.0 seconds. And of course, it would also be possible for David to take 3.031 seconds to respond, meaning that his RT would lie in between Cameron&rsquo;s and Alan&rsquo;s. And while in practice it might be impossible to measure RT that precisely, it&rsquo;s certainly possible in principle. Because we can always find a new value for RT in between any two other ones we regard RT as a continuous measure.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Discrete variables occur when this rule is violated. For example, nominal scale variables are always discrete. There isn&rsquo;t a type of transportation that falls &ldquo;in between&rdquo; trains and bicycles, not in the strict mathematical way that 2.3 falls in between 2 and 3. So transportation type is discrete. Similarly, ordinal scale variables are always discrete. Although &ldquo;2nd place&rdquo; does fall between &ldquo;1st place&rdquo; and &ldquo;3rd place&rdquo;, there&rsquo;s nothing that can logically fall in between &ldquo;1st place&rdquo; and &ldquo;2nd place&rdquo;. Interval scale and ratio scale variables can go either way. As we saw above, response time (a ratio scale variable) is continuous. Temperature in degrees celsius (an interval scale variable) is also continuous. However, the year you went to school (an interval scale variable) is discrete. There&rsquo;s no year in between 2002 and 2003. The number of questions you get right on a true-or-false test (a ratio scale variable) is also discrete. Since a true-or-false question doesn&rsquo;t allow you to be &ldquo;partially correct&rdquo;, there&rsquo;s nothing in between 5/10 and 6/10. Table </span><span class="c0 c45">2.1</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;summarizes the relationship between the scales of measurement and the discrete/continuity distinction. Cells with a tick mark correspond to things that are possible. I&rsquo;m trying to hammer this point home, because (a) some textbooks get this wrong, and (b) people very often say things like &ldquo;discrete variable&rdquo; when they mean &ldquo;nominal scale variable&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s very unfortunate.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">2.2.6</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c28 c55">Some complexity</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c1 c28">Okay, I know you&rsquo;re going to be shocked to hear this, but the real world is much messier than this little classification scheme suggests. Very few variables in real life actually fall into these nice neat categories, so you need to be kind of careful not to treat the scales of measurement as if they were hard and fast rules. It doesn&rsquo;t work like that. They&rsquo;re guidelines, intended to help you think about the situations in which you should treat different variables differently. Nothing more.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c28">So, let&rsquo;s take a classic example, maybe the classic example, of a psychological measurement tool: the </span><span class="c21">Likert scale</span><span class="c1 c28">. The humble Likert scale is the bread-and-butter tool of all survey design. You yourself have filled out hundreds, maybe thousands, of them and odds are you&rsquo;ve even used one yourself. Suppose we have a survey question that looks like this:</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c1 c28">Which of the following best describes your opinion of the statement that &ldquo;all pirates are freaking awesome&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c1 c28">and then the options presented to the participant are these:</span></p><ol class="c14 lst-kix_list_25-0 start" start="1"><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Strongly disagree</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Disagree</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Neither agree nor disagree</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Agree</span></li><li class="c33 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Strongly agree</span></li></ol><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">This set of items is an example of a 5-point Likert scale, in which people are asked to choose among one of several (in this case 5) clearly ordered possibilities, generally with a verbal descriptor given in each case. However, it&rsquo;s not necessary that all items are explicitly described. This is a perfectly good example of a 5-point Likert scale too:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c17 c99"><span class="c51 c52">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strongly disagree</span></p><p class="c17 c99"><span class="c51 c52">(2)</span></p><p class="c17 c99"><span class="c51 c52">(3)</span></p><p class="c17 c99"><span class="c51 c52">(4)</span></p><p class="c25 c99"><span class="c51 c52">(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strongly agree</span></p><p class="c25 c99 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Likert scales are very handy, if somewhat limited, tools. The question is what kind of variable are they? They&rsquo;re obviously discrete, since you can&rsquo;t give a response of 2.5. They&rsquo;re obviously not nominal scale, since the items are ordered; and they&rsquo;re not ratio scale either, since there&rsquo;s no natural zero.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">But are they ordinal scale or interval scale? One argument says that we can&rsquo;t really prove that the difference between &ldquo;strongly agree&rdquo; and &ldquo;agree&rdquo; is of the same size as the difference between &ldquo;agree&rdquo; and &ldquo;neither agree nor disagree&rdquo;. In fact, in everyday life it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that they&rsquo;re not the same at all. So, this suggests that we ought to treat Likert scales as ordinal variables. On the other hand, in practice most participants do seem to take the whole &ldquo;on a scale from 1 to 5&rdquo; part fairly seriously, and they tend to act as if the differences between the five response options were fairly similar to one another. As a consequence, a lot of researchers</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">treat Likert scale data as interval scale.</span><span class="c71">4</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s not interval scale, but in practice it&rsquo;s close enough that we usually think of it as being </span><span class="c38">quasi-interval scale</span><span class="c52 c70 c84">.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c31">2.3</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Assessing the reliability of a measurement</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c0">At this point we&rsquo;ve thought a little bit about how to operationalize a theoretical construct and thereby create a psychological measure. And we&rsquo;ve seen that by applying psychological measures we end up with variables, which can come in many different types. At this point, we should start discussing the obvious question: is the measurement any good? We&rsquo;ll do this in terms of two related ideas: </span><span class="c38">reliability</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and validity. Put simply, the reliability of a measure tells you how precisely you are measuring something, whereas the validity of a measure tells you how accurate the measure is. In this section I&rsquo;ll talk about reliability; we&rsquo;ll talk about validity in section </span><span class="c0 c45">2.6.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Reliability is actually a very simple concept. It refers to the repeatability or consistency of your measurement. The measurement of my weight by means of a &ldquo;bathroom scale&rdquo; is very reliable. If I step on and off the scales over and over again, it&rsquo;ll keep giving me the same answer. Measuring my intelligence by means of &ldquo;asking my mum&rdquo; is very unreliable. Some days she tells me I&rsquo;m a bit thick, and other days she tells me I&rsquo;m a complete idiot. Notice that this concept of reliability is different to the question of whether the measurements are correct (the correctness of a measurement relates to its validity). If I&rsquo;m holding a sack of potatoes when I step on and off the bathroom scales the measurement will still be reliable: it will always give me the same answer. However, this highly reliable answer doesn&rsquo;t match up to my true weight at all, therefore it&rsquo;s wrong. In technical terms, this is a reliable but invalid measurement. </span></p><hr><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c33"><img src="images/image5.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Ah, psychology . . . never an easy answer to anything!</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c51 c52">Similarly, whilst my mum&rsquo;s estimate of my intelligence is a bit unreliable, she might be right. Maybe I&rsquo;m just not too bright, and so while her estimate of my intelligence fluctuates pretty wildly from day to day, it&rsquo;s basically right. That would be an unreliable but valid measure. Of course, if my mum&rsquo;s estimates are too unreliable it&rsquo;s going to be very hard to figure out which one of her many claims about my intelligence is actually the right one. To some extent, then, a very unreliable measure tends to end up being invalid for practical purposes; so much so that many people would say that reliability is necessary (but not sufficient) to ensure validity.</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c51 c52">Okay, now that we&rsquo;re clear on the distinction between reliability and validity, let&rsquo;s have a think about the different ways in which we might measure reliability:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_23-0 start"><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c50 c13">Test-retest reliability.</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;This relates to consistency over time. If we repeat the measurement at a later date, do we get the same answer?</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c50 c13">Inter-rater reliability.</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;This relates to consistency across people. If someone else repeats the measurement (e.g., someone else rates my intelligence) will they produce the same answer?</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c50 c13">Parallel forms reliability.</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;This relates to consistency across theoretically-equivalent measurements. If I use a different set of bathroom scales to measure my weight, does it give the same answer?</span></li><li class="c33 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c50 c13">Internal consistency reliability.</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;If a measurement is constructed from lots of different parts that perform similar functions (e.g., a personality questionnaire result is added up across several questions) do the individual parts tend to give similar answers. We&rsquo;ll look at this particular form of reliability later in the book, in Section </span><span class="c52 c70 c45">15.5</span><span class="c51 c52">.</span></li></ul><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Not all measurements need to possess all forms of reliability. For instance, educational assessment can be thought of as a form of measurement. One of the subjects that I teach, Computational Cognitive Science, has an assessment structure that has a research component and an exam component (plus other things). The exam component is intended to measure something different from the research component, so the assessment as a whole has low internal consistency. However, within the exam there are several questions that are intended to (approximately) measure the same things, and those tend to produce similar outcomes. So, the exam on its own has a fairly high internal consistency. Which is as it should be. You should only demand reliability in those situations where you want to be measuring the same thing!</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c31">2.4</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">The &lsquo;role&rsquo; of variables: predictors and outcomes </span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">I&rsquo;ve got one last piece of terminology that I need to explain to you before moving away from variables. Normally, when we do some research, we end up with lots of different variables. Then, when we analyze our data, we usually try to explain some of the variables in terms of some of the other variables. It&rsquo;s important to keep the two roles &ldquo;thing doing the explaining&rdquo; and &ldquo;thing being explained&rdquo; distinct. So, let&rsquo;s be clear about this now. First, we might as well get used to the idea of using mathematical symbols to describe variables, since it&rsquo;s going to happen over and over again. Let&rsquo;s denote the &ldquo;to be explained&rdquo; variable </span><img src="images/image8.png"><span class="c0">, and denote the variables &ldquo;doing the explaining&rdquo; as</span><span>&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image9.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">, </span><img src="images/image10.png"><span class="c51 c52">, etc.</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c0">When we are doing an analysis, we have different names for </span><img src="images/image11.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><img src="images/image8.png"><span class="c0">, since they play different roles in the analysis. The classical names for these roles are </span><span class="c38">independent variable</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image12.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c38">dependent variable</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image13.png"><span>.</span><span class="c0">The </span><img src="images/image14.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;is the variable that you use to do the explaining (i.e., </span><img src="images/image11.png"><span class="c0">) and the </span><img src="images/image15.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;is the variable being explained (i.e., </span><img src="images/image8.png"><span class="c0">). The logic behind these names goes like this: if there really is a relationship between </span><img src="images/image11.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><img src="images/image8.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;then we can say that </span><img src="images/image8.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;depends on </span><img src="images/image11.png"><span class="c0">, and if we have designed our study &ldquo;properly&rdquo; then </span><img src="images/image11.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t dependent on anything else. However, I personally find those names horrible. They&rsquo;re hard to remember and they&rsquo;re highly misleading because (a) the </span><img src="images/image14.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;is never actually &ldquo;independent of everything else&rdquo;, and (b) if there&rsquo;s no relationship then the </span><img src="images/image15.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t actually depend on the </span><img src="images/image14.png"><span class="c0">. And in fact, because I&rsquo;m not the only person who thinks that </span><img src="images/image14.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><img src="images/image15.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;are just awful names, there are a number of alternatives that I find more appealing. The terms that I&rsquo;ll use in this book are </span><span class="c38">predictors</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c38">outcomes</span><span class="c0">. The idea here is that what you&rsquo;re trying to do is use </span><img src="images/image11.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;(the predictors) to make guesses about </span><img src="images/image8.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;(the outcomes).</span><span class="c71">5</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is summarized in Table </span><span class="c0 c45">2.2</span><span class="c51 c52">.</span></p><a id="t.fcfec419ff49f15019180e9b5f632078f7507e97"></a><a id="t.9"></a><table class="c87"><tbody><tr class="c11"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c1 c0">role of the variable</span></p></td><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">classical name</span></p></td><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">modern name</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">&ldquo;To be explained&rdquo;</span></p></td><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">dependent variable (DV)</span></p></td><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">outcome</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">&ldquo;To do the explaining&rdquo;</span></p></td><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">independent variable (IV)</span></p></td><td class="c5" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">predictor</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c19"><span class="c51 c52">Table 2.2: The terminology used to distinguish between different roles that a variable can play when analyzing a data set.

When we make this distinction, what we&rsquo;re really talking about is the degree of control that the researcher exercises over the people and events in the study.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">2.5.1</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c28 c55">Experimental research</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c28">The key feature of </span><span class="c21">experimental research</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;is that the researcher controls all aspects of the study, especially what participants experience during the study. In particular, the researcher manipulates or varies the predictor variables (</span><img src="images/image16.png"><span class="c28">) but allows the outcome variable (</span><img src="images/image15.png"><span class="c28">) to vary naturally. The idea here is to deliberately vary the predictors (</span><img src="images/image16.png"><span class="c28">) to see if they have any causal effects on the outcomes. Moreover, in order to ensure that there&rsquo;s no possibility that something other than the predictor variables is causing the outcomes, everything else is kept constant or is in some other way &ldquo;balanced&rdquo;, to ensure that they have no effect on the results. In practice, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to think of everything else that might have an influence on the outcome of an experiment, much less keep it constant. The standard solution to this is </span><span class="c21">randomization</span><span class="c28">. That is, we randomly assign people to different groups, and then give each group a different treatment (i.e., assign them different values of the predictor variables). We&rsquo;ll talk more about randomization later, but for now it&rsquo;s enough to say that what randomization does is minimize (but not eliminate) the possibility that there is any systematic difference between groups.</span></p><hr><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c1 c28"></span></p><p class="c15"><img src="images/image7.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Annoyingly though, there&rsquo;s a lot of different names used out there. I won&rsquo;t list all of them &ndash; there would be no point in doing that &ndash; other than to note that &ldquo;response variable&rdquo; is sometimes used where I&rsquo;ve used &ldquo;outcome&rdquo;. Sigh. This sort of terminological confusion is very common, I&rsquo;m afraid.</span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c1 c28"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c1 c28">Let&rsquo;s consider a very simple, completely unrealistic and grossly unethical example. Suppose you wanted to find out if smoking causes lung cancer. One way to do this would be to find people who smoke and people who don&rsquo;t smoke and look to see if smokers have a higher rate of lung cancer. This is not a proper experiment, since the researcher doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of control over who is and isn&rsquo;t a smoker. And this really matters. For instance, it might be that people who choose to smoke cigarettes also tend to have poor diets, or maybe they tend to work in asbestos mines, or whatever. The point here is that the groups (smokers and non-smokers) actually differ on lots of things, not just smoking. So it might be that the higher incidence of lung cancer among smokers is caused by something else, and not by smoking per se. In technical terms these other things (e.g., diet) are called &ldquo;confounders&rdquo;, and we&rsquo;ll talk about those in just a moment.</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c28">In the meantime, let&rsquo;s consider what a proper experiment might look like. Recall that our concern was that smokers and non-smokers might differ in lots of ways. The solution, as long as you have no ethics, is to control who smokes and who doesn&rsquo;t. Specifically, if we randomly divide young non-smokers into two groups and force half of them to become smokers, then it&rsquo;s very unlikely that the groups will differ in any respect other than the fact that half of them smoke. That way, if our smoking group gets cancer at a higher rate than the non-smoking group, we can feel pretty confident that (a) smoking does cause cancer and (b) we&rsquo;re murderers.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">2.5.2</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c28 c55">Non-experimental research</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c21">Non-experimental research</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;is a broad term that covers &ldquo;any study in which the researcher doesn&rsquo;t have as much control as they do in an experiment&rdquo;. Obviously, control is something that scientists like to have, but as the previous example illustrates there are lots of situations in which you can&rsquo;t or shouldn&rsquo;t try to obtain that control. Since it&rsquo;s grossly unethical (and almost certainly criminal) to force people to smoke in order to find out if they get cancer, this is a good example of a situation in which you really shouldn&rsquo;t try to obtain experimental control. But there are other reasons too. Even leaving aside the ethical issues, our &ldquo;smoking experiment&rdquo; does have a few other issues. For instance, when I suggested that we &ldquo;force&rdquo; half of the people to become smokers, I was talking about </span><span class="c62 c67">starting</span><span class="c1 c28">&nbsp;with a sample of non-smokers, and then forcing them to become smokers. While this sounds like the kind of solid, evil experimental design that a mad scientist would love, it might not be a very sound way of investigating the effect in the real world. For instance, suppose that smoking only causes lung cancer when people have poor diets, and suppose also that people who normally smoke do tend to have poor diets. However, since the &ldquo;smokers&rdquo; in our experiment aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;natural&rdquo; smokers (i.e., we forced non-smokers to become smokers, but they didn&rsquo;t take on all of the other normal, real-life characteristics that smokers might tend to possess) they probably have better diets. As such, in this silly example they wouldn&rsquo;t get lung cancer and our experiment will fail, because it violates the structure of the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; world (the technical name for this is an &ldquo;artefactual&rdquo; result).</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c28">One distinction worth making between two types of non-experimental research is the difference between </span><span class="c21">quasi-experimental research</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c61 c63">case studies</span><span class="c28">. The example I discussed earlier, in which we wanted to examine incidence of lung cancer among smokers and non-smokers without trying to control who smokes and who doesn&rsquo;t, is a quasi-experimental design. That is, it&rsquo;s the same as an experiment but we don&rsquo;t control the predictors (</span><img src="images/image16.png"><span class="c1 c28">). We can still use statistics to analyze the results, but we have to be a lot more careful and circumspect.</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c1 c28">The alternative approach, case studies, aims to provide a very detailed description of one or a few instances. In general, you can&rsquo;t use statistics to analyze the results of case studies and it&rsquo;s usually very hard to draw any general conclusions about &ldquo;people in general&rdquo; from a few isolated examples. However, case studies are very useful in some situations. Firstly, there are situations where you don&rsquo;t have any alternative. Neuropsychology has this issue a lot. Sometimes, you just can&rsquo;t find a lot of people with brain damage in a specific brain area, so the only thing you can do is describe those cases that you do have in as much detail and with as much care as you can. However, there&rsquo;s also some genuine advantages to case studies. Because you don&rsquo;t have as many people to study you have the ability to invest lots of time and effort trying to understand the specific factors at play in each case. This is a very valuable thing to do. As a consequence, case studies can complement the more statistically-oriented approaches that you see in experimental and quasi-experimental designs. We won&rsquo;t talk much about case studies in this book, but they are nevertheless very valuable tools!</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c31">2.6</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Assessing the validity of a study</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">More than any other thing, a scientist wants their research to be &ldquo;valid&rdquo;. The conceptual idea behind </span><span class="c50">validity</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;is very simple. Can you trust the results of your study? If not, the study is invalid. However, whilst it&rsquo;s easy to state, in practice it&rsquo;s much harder to check validity than it is to check reliability. And in all honesty, there&rsquo;s no precise, clearly agreed upon notion of what validity actually is. In fact, there are lots of different kinds of validity, each of which raises its own issues. And not all forms of validity are relevant to all studies. I&rsquo;m going to talk about five different types of validity:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_22-0 start"><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Internal validity</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">External validity</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Construct validity</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Face validity</span></li><li class="c33 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Ecological validity</span></li></ul><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">First, a quick guide as to what matters here. (1) Internal and external validity are the most important, since they tie directly to the fundamental question of whether your study really works. (2) Construct validity asks whether you&rsquo;re measuring what you think you are. (3) Face validity isn&rsquo;t terribly important except insofar as you care about &ldquo;appearances&rdquo;. (4) Ecological validity is a special case of face validity that corresponds to a kind of appearance that you might care about a lot.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">2.6.1</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c86 c55">Internal validity</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c21">Internal validity</span><span class="c1 c28">&nbsp;refers to the extent to which you are able draw the correct conclusions about the causal relationships between variables. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;internal&rdquo; because it refers to the relationships between things &ldquo;inside&rdquo; the study. Let&rsquo;s illustrate the concept with a simple example. Suppose you&rsquo;re interested in finding out whether a university education makes you write better. To do so, you get a group of first year students, ask them to write a 1000-word essay, and count the number of spelling and grammatical errors they make. Then you find some third-year students, who obviously have had more of a university education than the first-years, and repeat the exercise. And let&rsquo;s suppose it turns out that the third-year students produce fewer errors. And so, you conclude that a university education improves writing skills. Right?</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c1 c28">Except that the big problem with this experiment is that the third-year students are older and they&rsquo;ve had more experience with writing things. So, it&rsquo;s hard to know for sure what the causal relationship is. Do older people write better? Or people who have had more writing experience? Or people who have had more education? Which of the above is the true cause of the superior performance of the third-years? Age? Experience? Education? You can&rsquo;t tell. This is an example of a failure of internal validity, because your study doesn&rsquo;t properly tease apart the causal relationships between the different variables.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">2.6.2</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c86 c55">External validity</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c21">External validity</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;relates to the </span><span class="c21">generalizability</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c21">applicability</span><span class="c1 c28">&nbsp;of your findings. That is, to what extent do you expect to see the same pattern of results in &ldquo;real life&rdquo; as you saw in your study. To put it a bit more precisely, any study that you do in psychology will involve a fairly specific set of questions or tasks, will occur in a specific environment, and will involve participants that are drawn from a particular subgroup (disappointingly often it is college students!). So, if it turns out that the results don&rsquo;t actually generalize or apply to people and situations beyond the ones that you studied, then what you&rsquo;ve got is a lack of external validity.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c1 c28">The classic example of this issue is the fact that a very large proportion of studies in psychology will use undergraduate psychology students as the participants. Obviously, however, the researchers don&rsquo;t care only about psychology students. They care about people in general. Given that, a study that uses only psychology students as participants always carries a risk of lacking external validity. That is, if there&rsquo;s something &ldquo;special&rdquo; about psychology students that makes them different to the general population in some relevant respect, then we may start worrying about a lack of external validity.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c1 c28">That said, it is absolutely critical to realize that a study that uses only psychology students does not necessarily have a problem with external validity. I&rsquo;ll talk about this again later, but it&rsquo;s such a common mistake that I&rsquo;m going to mention it here. The external validity of a study is threatened by the choice of population if (a) the population from which you sample your participants is very narrow (e.g., psychology students), and (b) the narrow population that you sampled from is systematically different from the general population in some respect that is relevant to the psychological phenomenon that you intend to study. The italicized part is the bit that lots of people forget. It is true that psychology undergraduates differ from the general population in lots of ways, and so a study that uses only psychology students may have problems with external validity. However, if those differences aren&rsquo;t very relevant to the phenomenon that you&rsquo;re studying, then there&rsquo;s nothing to worry about. To make this a bit more concrete here are two extreme examples:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_21-0 start"><li class="c53 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">You want to measure &ldquo;attitudes of the general public towards psychotherapy&rdquo;, but all of your participants are psychology students. This study would almost certainly have a problem with external validity.</span></li><li class="c15 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">You want to measure the effectiveness of a visual illusion, and your participants are all psychology students. This study is unlikely to have a problem with external validity</span></li></ul><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">Having just spent the last couple of paragraphs focusing on the choice of participants, since that&rsquo;s a big issue that everyone tends to worry most about, it&rsquo;s worth remembering that external validity is a broader concept. The following are also examples of things that might pose a threat to external validity, depending on what kind of study you&rsquo;re doing:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_20-0 start"><li class="c53 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">People might answer a &ldquo;psychology questionnaire&rdquo; in a manner that doesn&rsquo;t reflect what they would do in real life.</span></li><li class="c66 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Your lab experiment on (say) &ldquo;human learning&rdquo; has a different structure to the learning problems people face in real life.</span></li></ul><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">2.6.3</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c86 c55">Construct validity</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c21">Construct validity</span><span class="c1 c28">&nbsp;is basically a question of whether you&rsquo;re measuring what you want to be measuring. A measurement has good construct validity if it is actually measuring the correct theoretical construct, and bad construct validity if it doesn&rsquo;t. To give a very simple (if ridiculous) example, suppose I&rsquo;m trying to investigate the rates with which university students cheat on their exams. And the way I attempt to measure it is by asking the cheating students to stand up in the lecture theatre so that I can count them. When I do this with a class of 300 students 0 people claim to be cheaters. So, I therefore conclude that the proportion of cheaters in my class is 0%. Clearly this is a bit ridiculous. But the point here is not that this is a very deep methodological example, but rather to explain what construct validity is. The problem with my measure is that while I&rsquo;m trying to measure &ldquo;the proportion of people who cheat&rdquo; what I&rsquo;m actually measuring is &ldquo;the proportion of people stupid enough to own up to cheating, or bloody minded enough to pretend that they do&rdquo;. Obviously, these aren&rsquo;t the same thing! So, my study has gone wrong, because my measurement has very poor construct validity.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">2.6.4</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c86 c55">Face validity</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c61 c63">Face validity</span><span class="c1 c28">&nbsp;simply refers to whether or not a measure &ldquo;looks like&rdquo; it&rsquo;s doing what it&rsquo;s supposed to, nothing more. If I design a test of intelligence, and people look at it and they say &ldquo;no, that test doesn&rsquo;t measure intelligence&rdquo;, then the measure lacks face validity. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. Obviously, face validity isn&rsquo;t very important from a pure scientific perspective. After all, what we care about is whether or not the measure actually does what it&rsquo;s supposed to do, not whether it looks like it does what it&rsquo;s supposed to do. As a consequence, we generally don&rsquo;t care very much about face validity. That said, the concept of face validity serves three useful pragmatic purposes:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_19-0 start"><li class="c53 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Sometimes, an experienced scientist will have a &ldquo;hunch&rdquo; that a particular measure won&rsquo;t work. While these sorts of hunches have no strict evidentiary value, it&rsquo;s often worth paying attention to them. Because often times people have knowledge that they can&rsquo;t quite verbalize, so there might be something to worry about even if you can&rsquo;t quite say why. In other words, when someone you trust criticizes the face validity of your study, it&rsquo;s worth taking the time to think more carefully about your design to see if you can think of reasons why it might go awry. Mind you, if you don&rsquo;t find any reason for concern, then you should probably not worry. After all, face validity really doesn&rsquo;t matter very much.</span></li><li class="c53 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Often (very often), completely uninformed people will also have a &ldquo;hunch&rdquo; that your research is crap. And they&rsquo;ll criticize it on the internet or something. On close inspection you may notice that these criticisms are actually focused entirely on how the study &ldquo;looks&rdquo;, but not on anything deeper. The concept of face validity is useful for gently explaining to people that they need to substantiate their arguments further.</span></li><li class="c66 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Expanding on the last point, if the beliefs of untrained people are critical (e.g., this is often the case for applied research where you actually want to convince policy makers of something or other) then you have to care about face validity. Simply because, whether you like it or not, a lot of people will use face validity as a proxy for real validity. If you want the government to change a law on scientific psychological grounds, then it won&rsquo;t matter how good your studies &ldquo;really&rdquo; are. If they lack face validity, you&rsquo;ll find that politicians ignore you. Of course, it&rsquo;s somewhat unfair that policy often depends more on appearance than fact, but that&rsquo;s how things go.</span></li></ul><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">2.6.5</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c86 c55">Ecological validity</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c21">Ecological validity</span><span class="c1 c28">&nbsp;is a different notion of validity, which is similar to external validity, but less important. The idea is that, in order to be ecologically valid, the entire set up of the study should closely approximate the real-world scenario that is being investigated. In a sense, ecological validity is a kind of face validity. It relates mostly to whether the study &ldquo;looks&rdquo; right, but with a bit more rigor to it. To be ecologically valid the study has to look right in a fairly specific way. The idea behind it is the intuition that a study that is ecologically valid is more likely to be externally valid. It&rsquo;s no guarantee, of course. But the nice thing about ecological validity is that it&rsquo;s much easier to check whether a study is ecologically valid than it is to check whether a study is externally valid. A simple example would be eyewitness identification studies. Most of these studies tend to be done in a university setting, often with a fairly simple array of faces to look at, rather than a line up. The length of time between seeing the &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; and being asked to identify the suspect in the &ldquo;line up&rdquo; is usually shorter. The &ldquo;crime&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t real so there&rsquo;s no chance of the witness being scared, and there are no police officers present so there&rsquo;s not as much chance of feeling pressured. These things all mean that the study definitely lacks ecological validity. They might (but might not) mean that it also lacks external validity.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c31">2.7</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Confounds, artefacts and other threats to validity</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">If we look at the issue of validity in the most general fashion the two biggest worries that we have are </span><span class="c76 c88">confounders</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c76 c88">artefacts</span><span class="c51 c52">. These two terms are defined in the following way:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_18-0 start"><li class="c42 c22 c53 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13 c50">Confounder:</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;A confounder is an additional, often unmeasured variable</span><img src="images/image17.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;that turns out to be related to both the predictors and the outcome. The existence of confounders threatens the internal validity of the study because you can&rsquo;t tell whether the predictor causes the outcome, or if the confounding variable causes it.</span></li><li class="c15 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c50 c13">Artefact:</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;A result is said to be &ldquo;artefactual&rdquo; if it only holds in the special situation that you happened to test in your study. The possibility that your result is an artefact describes a threat to your external validity, because it raises the possibility that you can&rsquo;t generalize or apply your results to the actual population that you care about.</span></li></ul><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">As a general rule confounders are a bigger concern for non-experimental studies, precisely because they&rsquo;re not proper experiments. By definition, you&rsquo;re leaving lots of things uncontrolled, so there&rsquo;s a lot of scope for confounders being present in your study. Experimental research tends to be much less vulnerable to confounders. The more control you have over what happens during the study, the more you can prevent confounders from affecting the results. With random allocation, for example, confounders are distributed randomly, and evenly, between different groups.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">However, there are always swings and roundabouts and when we start thinking about artifacts rather than confounders the shoe is very firmly on the other foot. For the most part, artefactual results tend to be a concern for experimental studies than for non-experimental studies. To see this, it helps to realize that the reason that a lot of studies are non-experimental is precisely because what the researcher is trying to do is examine human behavior in a more naturalistic context. By working in a more real-world context, you lose experimental control (making yourself vulnerable to confounders), but because you tend to be studying human psychology &ldquo;in the wild&rdquo; you reduce the chances of getting an artefactual result. Or, to put it another way, when you take psychology out of the wild and bring it into the lab (which we usually have to do to gain our experimental control), you always run the risk of accidentally studying something different to what you wanted to study.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">Be warned though. The above is a rough guide only. It&rsquo;s absolutely possible to have confounders in an experiment, and to get artefactual results with non-experimental studies. This can happen for all sorts of reasons, not least of which is experimenter or researcher error. In practice, it&rsquo;s really hard to think everything through ahead of time and even very good researchers make mistakes.</span></p><hr><p class="c66 c42 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c66 c42"><img src="images/image17.png"><span class="c1 c34">&nbsp;The reason why I say that it&rsquo;s unmeasured is that if you have measured it, then you can use some fancy statistical tricks to deal with the confounder. Because of the existence of these statistical solutions to the problem of confounders, we often refer to a confounder that we have measured and dealt with as a covariate. Dealing with covariates is a more advanced topic, but I thought I&rsquo;d mention it in passing since it&rsquo;s kind of comforting to at least know that this stuff exists.</span></p><p class="c66 c42 c23"><span class="c1 c34"></span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Although there&rsquo;s a sense in which almost any threat to validity can be characterized as a confounder or an artefact, they&rsquo;re pretty vague concepts. So, let&rsquo;s have a look at some of the most common examples.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">2.7.1</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c86 c55">History effects</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c21">History effects</span><span class="c1 c28">&nbsp;refer to the possibility that specific events may occur during the study that might influence the outcome measure. For instance, something might happen in between a pretest and a post-test. Or in-between testing participant 23 and participant 24. Alternatively, it might be that you&rsquo;re looking at a paper from an older study that was perfectly valid for its time, but the world has changed enough since then that the conclusions are no longer trustworthy. Examples of things that would count as history effects are:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_17-0 start"><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">You&rsquo;re interested in how people think about risk and uncertainty. You started your data collection in December 2010. But finding participants and collecting data takes time, so you&rsquo;re still finding new people in February 2011. Unfortunately for you (and even more unfortunately for others), the Queensland floods occurred in January 2011 causing billions of dollars of damage and killing many people. Not surprisingly, the people tested in February 2011 express quite different beliefs about handling risk than the people tested in December 2010. Which (if any) of these reflects the &ldquo;true&rdquo; beliefs of participants? I think the answer is probably both. The Queensland floods genuinely changed the beliefs of the Australian public, though possibly only temporarily. The key thing here is that the &ldquo;history&rdquo; of the people tested in February is quite different to people tested in December.</span></li><li class="c19 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1 c0">You&rsquo;re testing the psychological effects of a new anti-anxiety drug. So, what you do is measure anxiety before administering the drug (e.g., by self-report, and taking physiological measures). Then you administer the drug, and afterwards you take the same measures. In the middle however, because your lab is in Los Angeles, there&rsquo;s an earthquake which increases the anxiety of the participants.</span></li></ul><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">2.7.2</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c86 c55">Maturation effects </span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c28">As with history effects, </span><span class="c21">maturational effects</span><span class="c1 c28">&nbsp;are fundamentally about change over time. However, maturation effects aren&rsquo;t in response to specific events. Rather, they relate to how people change on their own over time. We get older, we get tired, we get bored, etc. Some examples of maturation effects are:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_16-0 start"><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">When doing developmental psychology research, you need to be aware that children grow up quite rapidly. So, suppose that you want to find out whether some educational trick helps with vocabulary size among 3-year-old. One thing that you need to be aware of is that the vocabulary size of children that age is growing at an incredible rate (multiple words per day) all on its own. If you design your study without taking this maturational effect into account, then you won&rsquo;t be able to tell if your educational trick works.</span></li><li class="c33 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">When running a very long experiment in the lab (say, something that goes for 3 hours) it&rsquo;s very likely that people will begin to get bored and tired, and that this maturational effect will cause performance to decline regardless of anything else going on in the experiment</span></li></ul><p class="c19"><span class="c55 c86">2.7.3</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c86 c55">Repeated testing effects</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c28">An important type of history effect is the effect of </span><span class="c21">repeated testing</span><span class="c1 c28">. Suppose I want to take two measurements of some psychological construct (e.g., anxiety). One thing I might be worried about is if the first measurement has an effect on the second measurement. In other words, this is a history effect in which the &ldquo;event&rdquo; that influences the second measurement is the first measurement itself! This is not at all uncommon. Examples of this include:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_15-0 start"><li class="c53 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c10">Learning and practice:</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;e.g., &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; at time 2 might appear to go up relative to time 1 because participants learned the general rules of how to solve &ldquo;intelligence-test-style&rdquo; questions during the first testing session.</span></li><li class="c53 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c10">Familiarity with the testing situation:</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;e.g., if people are nervous at time 1, this might make performance go down. But after sitting through the first testing situation, they might calm down a lot precisely because they&rsquo;ve seen what the testing looks like.</span></li><li class="c66 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c10">Auxiliary changes caused by testing:</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;e.g., if a questionnaire assessing mood is boring then mood rating at measurement time 2 is more likely to be &ldquo;bored&rdquo; precisely because of the boring measurement made at time 1.</span></li></ul><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">2.7.4</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c86 c55">Selection bias</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c21">Selection bias</span><span class="c1 c28">&nbsp;is a pretty broad term. Suppose that you&rsquo;re running an experiment with two groups of participants where each group gets a different &ldquo;treatment&rdquo;, and you want to see if the different treatments lead to different outcomes. However, suppose that, despite your best efforts, you&rsquo;ve ended up with a gender imbalance across groups (say, group A has 80% females and group B has 50% females). It might sound like this could never happen but, trust me, it can. This is an example of a selection bias, in which the people &ldquo;selected into&rdquo; the two groups have different characteristics. If any of those characteristics turns out to be relevant (say, your treatment works better on females than males) then you&rsquo;re in a lot of trouble.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">2.7.5</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Differential attrition</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c28">When thinking about the effects of attrition, it is sometimes helpful to distinguish between two different types. The first is </span><span class="c21">homogeneous attrition</span><span class="c1 c28">, in which the attrition effect is the same for all groups, treatments or conditions. In the example I gave above, the attrition would be homogeneous if (and only if) the easily bored participants are dropping out of all of the conditions in my experiment at about the same rate. In general, the main effect of homogeneous attrition is likely to be that it makes your sample unrepresentative. As such, the biggest worry that you&rsquo;ll have is that the generalizability of the results decreases. In other words, you lose external validity.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c28">The second type of attrition is </span><span class="c21">heterogeneous attrition</span><span class="c28">, in which the attrition effect is different for different groups. More often called </span><span class="c21">differential attrition</span><span class="c1 c28">, this is a kind of selection bias that is caused by the study itself. Suppose that, for the first time ever in the history of psychology, I manage to find the perfectly balanced and representative sample of people. I start running &ldquo;Dani&rsquo;s incredibly long and tedious experiment&rdquo; on my perfect sample but then, because my study is incredibly long and tedious, lots of people start dropping out. I can&rsquo;t stop this. Participants absolutely have the right to stop doing any experiment, any time, for whatever reason they feel like, and as researchers we are morally (and professionally) obliged to remind people that they do have this right. So, suppose that &ldquo;Dani&rsquo;s incredibly long and tedious experiment&rdquo; has a very high dropout rate. What do you suppose the odds are that this drop out is random? Answer: zero. Almost certainly the people who remain are more conscientious, more tolerant of boredom, etc., than those that leave. To the extent that (say) conscientiousness is relevant to the psychological phenomenon that I care about, this attrition can decrease the validity of my results.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c1 c28">Here&rsquo;s another example. Suppose I design my experiment with two conditions. In the &ldquo;treatments&rdquo; condition, the experimenter insults the participant and then gives them a questionnaire designed to measure obedience. In the &ldquo;control&rdquo; condition, the experimenter engages in a bit of pointless chitchat and then gives them the questionnaire. Leaving aside the questionable scientific merits and dubious ethics of such a study, let&rsquo;s have a think about what might go wrong here. As a general rule, when someone insults me to my face, I tend to get much less co-operative. So, there&rsquo;s a pretty good chance that a lot more people are going to drop out of the treatment condition than the control condition. And this drop out isn&rsquo;t going to be random. The people most likely to drop out would probably be the people who don&rsquo;t care all that much about the importance of obediently sitting through the experiment. Since the bloodiest minded and disobedient people all left the treatment group but not the control group, we&rsquo;ve introduced a confound: the people who actually took the questionnaire in the treatment group were already more likely to be dutiful and obedient than the people in the control group. In short, in this study insulting people doesn&rsquo;t make them more obedient. It makes the more disobedient people leave the experiment! The internal validity of this experiment is completely shot.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">2.7.6</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Non-response bias</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c21">Non-response bias</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;is closely related to selection bias and to differential attrition. The simplest version of the problem goes like this. You mail out a survey to 1000 people but only 300 of them reply. The 300 people who replied are almost certainly not a random subsample. People who respond to surveys are systematically different to people who don&rsquo;t. This introduces a problem when trying to generalize from those 300 people who replied to the population at large, since you now have a very non-random sample. The issue of non-response bias is more general than this, though. Among the (say) 300 people that did respond to the survey, you might find that not everyone answers every question. If (say) 80 people chose not to answer one of your questions, does this introduce problems? As always, the answer is maybe. If the question that wasn&rsquo;t answered was on the last page of the questionnaire, and those 80 surveys were returned with the last page missing, there&rsquo;s a good chance that the missing data isn&rsquo;t a big deal; probably the pages just fell off. However, if the question that 80 people didn&rsquo;t answer was the most confrontational or invasive personal question in the questionnaire, then almost certainly you&rsquo;ve got a problem. In essence, what you&rsquo;re dealing with here is what&rsquo;s called the problem of </span><span class="c21">missing data</span><span class="c1 c28">. If the data that is missing was &ldquo;lost&rdquo; randomly, then it&rsquo;s not a big problem. If it&rsquo;s missing systematically, then it can be a big problem.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">2.7.7</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Regression to the mean</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c21">Regression to the mean</span><span class="c1 c28">&nbsp;refers to any situation where you select data based on an extreme value on some measure. Because the variable has natural variation it almost certainly means that when you take a subsequent measurement the later measurement will be less extreme than the first one, purely by chance.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c1 c28">Here&rsquo;s an example. Suppose I&rsquo;m interested in whether a psychology education has an adverse effect on very smart kids. To do this, I find the 20 psychology I students with the best high school grades and look at how well they&rsquo;re doing at university. It turns out that they&rsquo;re doing a lot better than average, but they&rsquo;re not topping the class at university even though they did top their classes at high school. What&rsquo;s going on? The natural first thought is that this must mean that the psychology classes must be having an adverse effect on those students. However, while that might very well be the explanation, it&rsquo;s more likely that what you&rsquo;re seeing is an example of &ldquo;regression to the mean&rdquo;. To see how it works, let&rsquo;s take a moment to think about what is required to get the best mark in a class, regardless of whether that class be at high school or at university. When you&rsquo;ve got a big class there are going to be lots of very smart people enrolled. To get the best mark you have to be very smart, work very hard, and be a bit lucky. The exam has to ask just the right questions for your idiosyncratic skills, and you have to avoid making any dumb mistakes (we all do that sometimes) when answering them. And that&rsquo;s the thing, whilst intelligence and hard work are transferable from one class to the next, luck isn&rsquo;t. The people who got lucky in high school won&rsquo;t be the same as the people who get lucky at university. That&rsquo;s the very definition of &ldquo;luck&rdquo;. The consequence of this is that when you select people at the very extreme values of one measurement (the top 20 students), you&rsquo;re selecting for hard work, skill and luck. But because the luck doesn&rsquo;t transfer to the second measurement (only the skill and work), these people will all be expected to drop a little bit when you measure them a second time (at university). So, their scores fall back a little bit, back towards everyone else. This is regression to the mean.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c28">Regression to the mean is surprisingly common. For instance, if two very tall people have kids their children will tend to be taller than average but not as tall as the parents. The reverse happens with very short parents. Two very short parents will tend to have short children, but nevertheless those kids will tend to be taller than the parents. It can also be extremely subtle. For instance, there have been studies done that suggested that people learn better from negative feedback than from positive feedback. However, the way that people tried to show this was to give people positive reinforcement whenever they did good, and negative reinforcement when they did bad. And what you see is that after the positive reinforcement people tended to do worse, but after the negative reinforcement they tended to do better. But notice that there&rsquo;s a selection bias here! When people do very well, you&rsquo;re selecting for &ldquo;high&rdquo; values, and so you should expect, because of regression to the mean, that performance on the next trial should be worse regardless of whether reinforcement is given. Similarly, after a bad trial, people will tend to improve all on their own. The apparent superiority of negative feedback is an artefact caused by regression to the mean (see </span><span class="c7 c63">(Kahneman and Tversky 1973)</span><span class="c1 c28">, for discussion).</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">2.7.8</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Experimental bias</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c38">Experimenter bias</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;can come in multiple forms. The basic idea is that the experimenter, despite the best of intentions, can accidentally end up influencing the results of the experiment by subtly communicating the &ldquo;right answer&rdquo; or the &ldquo;desired behavior&rdquo; to the participants. Typically, this occurs because the experimenter has special knowledge that the participant does not, for example the right answer to the questions being asked or knowledge of the expected pattern of performance for the condition that the participant is in. The classic example of this happening is the case study of &ldquo;Clever Hans&rdquo;, which dates back to 1907 (</span><span class="c45">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">(Pfungst et al. 1911)</span><span class="c0 c45">;</span><span class="c45">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">(Hothersall 2004)</span><span class="c51 c52">) . Clever Hans was a horse that apparently was able to read and count and perform other human like feats of intelligence. After Clever Hans became famous, psychologists started examining his behavior more closely. It turned out that, not surprisingly, Hans didn&rsquo;t know how to do math. Rather, Hans was responding to the human observers around him, because the humans did know how to count and the horse had learned to change its behavior when people changed theirs.</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c51 c52">The general solution to the problem of experimenter bias is to engage in double blind studies, where neither the experimenter nor the participant knows which condition the participant is in or knows what the desired behavior is. This provides a very good solution to the problem, but it&rsquo;s important to recognize that it&rsquo;s not quite ideal, and hard to pull off perfectly. For instance, the obvious way that I could try to construct a double-blind study is to have one of my Ph.D. students (one who doesn&rsquo;t know anything about the experiment) run the study. That feels like it should be enough. The only person (me) who knows all the details (e.g., correct answers to the questions, assignments of participants to conditions) has no interaction with the participants, and the person who does all the talking to people (the Ph.D. student) doesn&rsquo;t know anything. Except for the reality that the last part is very unlikely to be true. In order for the Ph.D. student to run the study effectively they need to have been briefed by me, the researcher. And, as it happens, the Ph.D. student also knows me and knows a bit about my general beliefs about people and psychology (e.g., I tend to think humans are much smarter than psychologists give them credit for). As a result of all this, it&rsquo;s almost impossible for the experimenter to avoid knowing a little bit about what expectations I have. And even a little bit of knowledge can have an effect. Suppose the experimenter accidentally conveys the fact that the participants are expected to do well in this task. Well, there&rsquo;s a thing called the &ldquo;Pygmalion effect&rdquo;, where if you expect great things of people they&rsquo;ll tend to rise to the occasion. But if you expect them to fail then they&rsquo;ll do that too. In other words, the expectations become a self-fulfilling prophesy.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">2.7.9</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Demand effects and reactivity</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c28">When talking about experimenter bias, the worry is that the experimenter&rsquo;s knowledge or desires for the experiment are communicated to the participants, and that these can change people&rsquo;s behavior</span><span class="c63">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c63">(Rosenthal 1976)</span><span class="c28">. However, even if you manage to stop this from happening, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to stop people from knowing that they&rsquo;re part of a psychological study. And the mere fact of knowing that someone is watching or studying you can have a pretty big effect on behavior. This is generally referred to as </span><span class="c21">reactivity</span><span class="c28">&nbsp;or </span><span class="c21">demand effects</span><span class="c28">. The basic idea is captured by the Hawthorne effect: people alter their performance because of the attention that the study focuses on them. The effect takes its name from a study that took place in the &ldquo;Hawthorne Works&rdquo; factory outside of Chicago </span><span class="c7 c63">(Adair 1984)</span><span class="c1 c28">. This study, from the 1920s, looked at the effects of factory lighting on worker productivity. But, importantly, change in worker behavior occurred because the workers knew they were being studied, rather than any effect of factory lighting.</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c1 c28">To get a bit more specific about some of the ways in which the mere fact of being in a study can change how people behave, it helps to think like a social psychologist and look at some of the roles that people might adopt during an experiment but might not adopt if the corresponding events were occurring in the real world:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_14-0 start"><li class="c53 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">The </span><span class="c51 c10">good participant</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;tries to be too helpful to the researcher.

It refers to the situation where the mere fact of being treated causes an improvement in outcomes. The classic example comes from clinical trials. If you give people a completely chemically inert drug and tell them that it&rsquo;s a cure for a disease, they will tend to get better faster than people who aren&rsquo;t treated at all. In other words, it is people&rsquo;s belief that they are being treated that causes the improved outcomes, not the drug.</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c28">However, the current consensus in medicine is that true placebo effects are quite rare and most of what was previously considered placebo effect is in fact some combination of natural healing (some people just get better on their own), regression to the mean and other quirks of study design.

While reading what the textbooks often have to say about assessing the validity of a study, I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that they seem to make the assumption that the researcher is honest. I find this hilarious. While the vast majority of scientists are honest, in my experience at least, some are not.</span><span class="c62 c71">7</span><span class="c1 c62">&nbsp;Not only that, as I mentioned earlier, scientists are not immune to belief bias. It&rsquo;s easy for a researcher to end up deceiving themselves into believing the wrong thing, and this can lead them to conduct subtly flawed research and then hide those flaws when they write it up. So, you need to consider not only the (probably unlikely) possibility of outright fraud but also the (probably quite common) possibility that the research is unintentionally &ldquo;slanted&rdquo;. I opened a few standard textbooks and didn&rsquo;t find much of a discussion of this problem, so here&rsquo;s my own attempt to list a few ways in which these issues can arise:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_13-0 start"><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c38 c13">Data fabrication:</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Sometimes, people just make up the data. This is occasionally done with &ldquo;good&rdquo; intentions. For instance, the researcher believes that the fabricated data do reflect the truth, and may actually reflect &ldquo;slightly cleaned up&rdquo; versions of actual data. On other occasions, the fraud is deliberate and malicious. Some high-profile examples where data fabrication has been alleged or shown include Cyril Burt (a psychologist who is thought to have fabricated some of his data), Andrew Wakefield (who has been accused of fabricating his data connecting the MMR vaccine to autism) and Hwang Woo-suk (who falsified a lot of his data on stem cell research).</span></li></ul><p class="c17 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><hr><p class="c17 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c17 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c17"><img src="images/image18.png"><span>&nbsp;S</span><span class="c79">ome people might argue that if you&rsquo;re not honest then you&rsquo;re not a real scientist. Which does have some truth to it I guess, but that&rsquo;s disingenuous (look up the &ldquo;No true Scotsman&rdquo; fallacy). The fact is that there are lots of people who are employed ostensibly as scientists, and whose work has all of the </span><span class="c51 c52">trappings of science, but who are outright fraudulent. Pretending that they don&rsquo;t exist by saying that they&rsquo;re not scientists is just muddled thinking.</span></p><p class="c17 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c17 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_13-0"><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c13 c38">Hoaxes:</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Hoaxes share a lot of similarities with data fabrication, but they differ in the intended purpose. A hoax is often a joke, and many of them are intended to be (eventually) discovered. Often, the point of a hoax is to discredit someone or some field. There&rsquo;re quite a few well-known scientific hoaxes that have occurred over the years (e.g., Piltdown man) and some were deliberate attempts to discredit particular fields of research (e.g., the Sokal affair).</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c50 c13">Data misrepresentation:</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;While fraud gets most of the headlines, it&rsquo;s much more common in my experience to see data being misrepresented. When I say this, I&rsquo;m not referring to newspapers getting it wrong (which they do, almost always). I&rsquo;m referring to the fact that often the data don&rsquo;t actually say what the researchers think they say. My guess is that, almost always, this isn&rsquo;t the result of deliberate dishonesty but instead is due to a lack of sophistication in the data analyses. For instance, think back to the example of Simpson&rsquo;s paradox that I discussed in the beginning of this book. It&rsquo;s very common to see people present &ldquo;aggregated&rdquo; data of some kind and sometimes when you dig deeper and find the raw data yourself you find that the aggregated data tell a different story to the disaggregated data. Alternatively, you might find that some aspect of the data is being hidden, because it tells an inconvenient story (e.g., the researcher might choose not to refer to a particular variable). There&rsquo;s a lot of variants on this, many of which are very hard to detect.</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c50 c13">Study &ldquo;misdesign&rdquo;:</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Okay, this one is subtle. Basically, the issue here is that a researcher designs a study that has built-in flaws and those flaws are never reported in the paper. The data that are reported are completely real and are correctly analyzed, but they are produced by a study that is actually quite wrongly put together. The researcher really wants to find a particular effect and so the study is set up in such a way as to make it &ldquo;easy&rdquo; to (artefactually) observe that effect. One sneaky way to do this, in case you&rsquo;re feeling like dabbling in a bit of fraud yourself, is to design an experiment in which it&rsquo;s obvious to the participants what they&rsquo;re &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; to be doing, and then let reactivity work its magic for you. If you want you can add all the trappings of double-blind experimentation but it won&rsquo;t make a difference since the study materials themselves are subtly telling people what you want them to do. When you write up the results the fraud won&rsquo;t be obvious to the reader. What&rsquo;s obvious to the participant when they&rsquo;re in the experimental context isn&rsquo;t always obvious to the person reading the paper. Of course, the way I&rsquo;ve described this makes it sound like its always fraud. Probably there are cases where this is done deliberately, but in my experience the bigger concern has been with unintentional misdesign. The researcher believes and so the study just happens to end up with a built-in flaw, and that flaw then magically erases itself when the study is written up for publication.</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c50 c13">Data mining &amp; post hoc hypothesizing:</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Another way in which the authors of a study can more or less misrepresent the data is by engaging in what&rsquo;s referred to as &ldquo;data mining&rdquo; (see </span><span class="c7">Gelman and Loken 2014</span><span class="c51 c52">, for a broader discussion of this as part of the &ldquo;garden of forking paths&rdquo; in statistical analysis). As we&rsquo;ll discuss later, if you keep trying to analyze your data in lots of different ways, you&rsquo;ll eventually find something that &ldquo;looks&rdquo; like a real effect but isn&rsquo;t. This is referred to as &ldquo;data mining&rdquo;. It used to be quite rare because data analysis used to take weeks, but now that everyone has very powerful statistical software on their computers it&rsquo;s becoming very common. Data mining per se isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;, but the more that you do it the bigger the risk you&rsquo;re taking. The thing that is wrong, and I suspect is very common, is unacknowledged data mining. That is, the researcher runs every possible analysis known to humanity, finds the one that works, and then pretends that this was the only analysis that they ever conducted. Worse yet, they often &ldquo;invent&rdquo; a hypothesis after looking at the data to cover up the data mining. To be clear. It&rsquo;s not wrong to change your beliefs after looking at the data, and to reanalyze your data using your new &ldquo;post hoc&rdquo; hypotheses. What is wrong (and I suspect common) is failing to acknowledge that you&rsquo;ve done. If you acknowledge that you, did it then other researchers are able to take your behavior into account. If you don&rsquo;t, then they can&rsquo;t. And that makes your behavior deceptive. Bad!</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c50 c13">Publication bias &amp; self-censoring:</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Finally, a pervasive bias is &ldquo;non-reporting&rdquo; of negative results. This is almost impossible to prevent. Journals don&rsquo;t publish every article that is submitted to them. They prefer to publish articles that find &ldquo;something&rdquo;. So, if 20 people run an experiment looking at whether reading Finnegans Wake causes insanity in humans, and 19 of them find that it doesn&rsquo;t, which one do you think is going to get published? Obviously, it&rsquo;s the one study that did find that Finnegans Wake causes insanity.</span><span class="c71">8</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">This is an example of a publication bias. Since no-one ever published the 19 studies that didn&rsquo;t find an effect, a naive reader would never know that they existed. Worse yet, most researchers &ldquo;internalize&rdquo; this bias and end up self-censoring their research. Knowing that negative results aren&rsquo;t going to be accepted for publication, they never even try to report them. As a friend of mine says &ldquo;for every experiment that you get published, you also have 10 failures&rdquo;. And she&rsquo;s right. The catch is, while some (maybe most) of those studies are failures for boring reasons (e.g., you stuffed something up) others might be genuine &ldquo;null&rdquo; results that you ought to acknowledge when you write up the &ldquo;good&rdquo; experiment. And telling which is which is often hard to do. A good place to start is a paper by </span><span class="c7">Ioannidis 2005</span><span class="c45">&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">with the depressing title &ldquo;Why most published research findings are false&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d also suggest taking a look at work by </span><span class="c7">(K&uuml;hberger, Fritz, and Scherndl 2014)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">presenting statistical evidence that this actually happens in psychology.</span></li></ul><p class="c17"><span class="c51 c52">There&rsquo;s probably a lot more issues like this to think about, but that&rsquo;ll do to start with. What I really want to point out is the blindingly obvious truth that real world science is conducted by actual humans, and only the most gullible of people automatically assumes that everyone else is honest and impartial. Actual scientists aren&rsquo;t usually that naive, but for some reason the world likes to pretend that we are, and the textbooks we usually write seem to reinforce that stereotype.</span></p><p class="c17 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c31">2.8</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Summary</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c51 c52">This chapter isn&rsquo;t really meant to provide a comprehensive discussion of psychological research methods.

Our goal in this chapter is not to learn any statistical concepts: we&rsquo;re just trying to learn the basics of how jamovi works and get comfortable interacting with the system. To do this we&rsquo;ll spend a bit of time looking at datasets and variables. In doing so, you&rsquo;ll get a bit of a feel for what it&rsquo;s like to work in jamovi.</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c1 c62">However, before going into any of the specifics, it&rsquo;s worth talking a little about why you might want to use jamovi at all.

However, if those reasons are &ldquo;because that&rsquo;s what my stats class uses&rdquo;, it might be worth explaining a little why your lecturer has chosen to use jamovi for the class.

Computers excel at mindless repetitive tasks, and a lot of statistical calculations are both mindless and repetitive. For most people the only reason to ever do statistical calculations with pencil and paper is for learning purposes. In my class I do occasionally suggest doing some calculations that way, but the only real value to it is pedagogical. It does help you to get a &ldquo;feel&rdquo; for statistics to do some calculations yourself, so it&rsquo;s worth doing it once. But only once!</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Doing statistics in a conventional spreadsheet (e.g., Microsoft Excel) is generally a bad idea in the long run. Although many people likely feel more familiar with them, spreadsheets are very limited in terms of what analyses they allow you do. If you get into the habit of trying to do your real-life data analysis using spreadsheets then you&rsquo;ve dug yourself into a very deep hole.</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Avoiding proprietary software is a very good idea. There are a lot of commercial packages out there that you can buy, some of which I like and some of which I don&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re usually very glossy in their appearance and generally very powerful (much more powerful than spreadsheets). However, they&rsquo;re also very expensive. Usually, the company sells &ldquo;student versions&rdquo; (crippled versions of the real thing) very cheaply, and then they they sell full powered &ldquo;educational versions&rdquo; at a price that makes me wince. They will also sell commercial licences with a </span></li></ul><hr><p class="c17 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c17 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c17"><img src="images/image2.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Source: Dismal Light (1968).</span></p><p class="c17 c40"><span class="c51 c52">staggeringly high price tag. The business model here is to suck you in during your student days and then leave you dependent on their tools when you go out into the real world. It&rsquo;s hard to blame them for trying, but personally I&rsquo;m not in favour of shelling out thousands of dollars if I can avoid it. And you can avoid it. If you make use of packages like jamovi that are open source and free you never get trapped having to pay exorbitant licensing fees.</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_11-0"><li class="c33 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Something that you might not appreciate now, but will love later on if you do anything involving data analysis, is the fact that jamovi is basically a sophisticated front end for the free R statistical programming language. When you download and install R you get all the basic &ldquo;packages&rdquo; and those are very powerful on their own. However, because R is so open and so widely used, it&rsquo;s become something of a standard tool in statistics and so lots of people write their own packages that extend the system. And these are freely available too. One of the consequences of this, I&rsquo;ve noticed, is that if you look at recent advanced data analysis textbooks then a lot of them use R.</span></li></ul><p class="c33"><span class="c0">Those are the main reasons I use jamovi. It&rsquo;s not without its flaws, though. It&rsquo;s relatively new</span><span class="c71">2</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;so there is not a huge set of textbooks and other resources to support it, and it has a few annoying quirks that we&rsquo;re all pretty much stuck with, but on the whole, I think the strengths outweigh the weakness; more so than any other option I&rsquo;ve encountered so far.</span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c31">3.1</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c31">Installing jamovi</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c51 c52">Okay, enough with the sales pitch. Let&rsquo;s get started. Just as with any piece of software, jamovi needs to be installed on a &ldquo;computer&rdquo;, which is a magical box that does cool things and delivers free ponies. Or something along those lines; I may be confusing computers with the iPad marketing campaigns. Anyway, jamovi is freely distributed online and you can download it from the jamovi homepage, which is:</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c110 c0"><a class="c47" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.jamovi.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1645374859329538&amp;usg=AOvVaw22dX6uPf60I64opW32Sbpv">https://www.jamovi.org/</a></span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">At the top of the page, under the heading &ldquo;Download&rdquo;, you&rsquo;ll see separate links for Windows users, Mac users, and Linux users. If you follow the relevant link, you&rsquo;ll see that the online instructions are pretty self-explanatory. As of this writing, the current version of jamovi is 0.9, but they usually issue updates every few months, so you&rsquo;ll probably have a newer version.</span><span class="c52 c88 c55 c136 c71">3</span></p><p class="c19 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c19 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><hr><p class="c19 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c19"><img src="images/image3.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;As of writing this in August 2018.</span></p><p class="c19"><img src="images/image4.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Although jamovi is updated frequently it doesn&rsquo;t usually make much of a difference for the sort of work we&rsquo;ll do in this book. In fact, during the writing of the book I upgraded several times and it didn&rsquo;t make much difference at all to what is in this book.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">3.1.1</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Starting up jamovi</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c0">One way or another, regardless of what operating system you&rsquo;re using, it&rsquo;s time to open jamovi and get started. When first starting jamovi you will be presented with a user interface which looks something like Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">3.1</span><span class="c51 c52">.</span></p><p class="c42 c57"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 301.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image302.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 301.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c57 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 3.1: jamovi looks like this when you start it.</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c51 c52">To the left is the spreadsheet view, and to the right is where the results of statistical tests appear. Down the middle is a bar separating these two regions and this can be dragged to the left or the right to change their sizes.</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c51 c52">It is possible to simply begin typing values into the jamovi spreadsheet as you would in any other spreadsheet software. Alternatively, existing data sets in the CSV (.csv) file format can be opened in jamovi. Additionally, you can easily import SPSS, SAS, Stata and JASP files directly into jamovi. To open a file, select the File tab (three horizontal lines signify this tab) at the top left-hand corner, select &lsquo;Open&rsquo; and then choose from the files listed on &rsquo;Browse&rsquo; depending on whether you want to open an example or a file stored on your computer.</span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c31">3.2</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c31">Analysis</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c51 c52">Analyses can be selected from the analysis ribbon or menu along the top. Selecting an analysis will present an &lsquo;options panel&rsquo; for that particular analysis, allowing you to assign different variables to different parts of the analysis, and select different options. At the same time, the results for the analysis will appear in the right &lsquo;Results panel&rsquo; and will update in real-time as you make changes to the options.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c51 c52">When you have the analysis set up correctly you can dismiss the analysis options by clicking the arrow to the top right of the optional panel. If you wish to return to these options, you can click on the results that were produced. In this way, you can return to any analysis that you (or say, a colleague) created earlier.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c51 c52">If you decide you no longer need a particular analysis, you can remove it with the results context menu. Right-clicking on the analysis results will bring up a menu and by selecting &lsquo;Analysis&rsquo; and then &lsquo;Remove&rsquo; the analysis can be removed. But more on this later. First, let&rsquo;s take a more detailed look at the spreadsheet view.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c31">3.3</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c31">The spreadsheet</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c51 c52">In jamovi data is represented in a spreadsheet with each column representing a &lsquo;variable&rsquo; and each row representing a &lsquo;case&rsquo; or &lsquo;participant&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">3.3.1</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Variables</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c51 c52">The most commonly used variables in jamovi are &lsquo;Data Variables&rsquo;, these variables simply contain data either loaded from a data file, or &lsquo;typed in&rsquo; by the user. Data variables can be one of three measurement levels:</span></p><p class="c30"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 246.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image301.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 246.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">These levels are designated by the symbol in the header of the variable&rsquo;s column.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">The ID variable type is unique to jamovi. It&rsquo;s intended for variables that contain identifiers that you would almost never want to analyze. For example, a person&#39;s name, or a participant ID. Specifying an ID variable type can improve performance when interacting with very large data sets.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c10 c88">Nominal</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;variables are for categorical variables which are text labels, for example a column called Gender with the values Male and Female would be nominal. So would a person&rsquo;s name. Nominal variable values can also have a numeric value. These variables are used most often when importing data which codes values with numbers rather than text. For example, a column in a dataset may contain the values 1 for males, and 2 for females. It is possible to add nice &lsquo;human-readable&rsquo; labels to these values with the variable editor (more on this later).</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c10 c88">Ordinal</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;variables are like Nominal variables, except the values have a specific order. An example is a Likert scale with 3 being &lsquo;strongly agree&rsquo; and -3 being &lsquo;strongly disagree&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c10 c88">Continuous</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;variables are variables which exist on a continuous scale. Examples might be height or weight. This is also referred to as &lsquo;Interval&rsquo; or &lsquo;Ratio scale&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">In addition, you can also specify different data types: variables have a data type of either &lsquo;Text&rsquo;, &lsquo;Integer&rsquo; or &lsquo;Decimal&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">When starting with a blank spreadsheet and typing values in the variable type will change automatically depending on the data you enter. This is a good way to get a feel for which variable types go with which sorts of data. Similarly, when opening a data file jamovi will try and guess the variable type from the data in each column. In both cases this automatic approach may not be correct, and it may be necessary to manually specify the variable type with the variable editor.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">The variable editor can be opened by selecting &lsquo;Setup&rsquo; from the data tab or by double-clicking on the variable column header. The variable editor allows you to change the name of the variable and, for data variables, the variable type, the order of the levels, and the label displayed for each level. Changes can be applied by clicking the &lsquo;tick&rsquo; to the top right. The variable editor can be dismissed by clicking the &lsquo;Hide&rsquo; arrow.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">New variables can be inserted or appended to the data set using the &lsquo;add&rsquo; button from the data ribbon. The &lsquo;add&rsquo; button also allows the addition of computed variables.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">3.3.2</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Computed variables</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">Computed Variables are those which take their value by performing a computation on other variables. Computed Variables can be used for a range of purposes, including log transforms, z-scores, sum-scores, negative scoring and means.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">Computed variables can be added to the data set with the &lsquo;add&rsquo; button available on the data tab. This will produce a formula box where you can specify the formula. The usual arithmetic operators are available. Some examples of formulas are:</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">A + B</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">LOG10(len)</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">MEAN(A, B)</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">(dose - VMEAN(dose)) / VSTDEV(dose)</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c0">In order, these are the sum of A and B, a log (base 10) transform of len, the mean of A and B, and the z-score of the variable dose. Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">3.2</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;below shows the jamovi screen for the new variable computed as the z-score of dose (from the &lsquo;Tooth Growth&rsquo; example data set).</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 465.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image304.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 465.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 3.2: A newly computed variable, the z-score of &lsquo;dose&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 subtitle"><span>V-functions</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c51 c52">Several functions are already available in jamovi and available from the drop-down box labelled fx. A number of functions appear in pairs, one prefixed with a V and the other not. V functions perform their calculation on a variable as a whole, where as non-V functions perform their calculation row by row. For example, MEAN(A, B) will produce the mean of A and B for each row. Whereas VMEAN(A) gives the mean of all the values in A.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">3.3.3</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Copy and paste</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c51 c52">jamovi produces nice American Psychological Association (APA) formatted tables and attractive plots. It is often useful to be able to copy and paste these, perhaps into a Word document, or into an email to a colleague. To copy results right click on the object of interest and from the menu select exactly what you want to copy. The menu allows you to choose to copy only the image or the entire analysis. Selecting &ldquo;copy&rdquo; copies the content to the clipboard and this can be pasted into other programs in the usual way. You can practice this later on when we do some analyses.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">3.3.4</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Syntax mode</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c51 c52">jamovi also provides an &ldquo;R Syntax Mode&rdquo;. In this mode jamovi produces equivalent R code for each analysis. To change to syntax mode, select the Application menu to the top right of jamovi (a button with three vertical dots) and click the &ldquo;Syntax mode&rdquo; checkbox there. You can turn off syntax mode by clicking this a second time.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c51 c52">In syntax mode analyses continue to operate as before but now they produce R syntax, and &lsquo;ascii output&rsquo; like an R session. Like all results objects in jamovi, you can right click on these items (including the R syntax) and copy and paste them, for example into an R session. At present, the provided R syntax does not include the data import step and so this must be performed manually in R. There are many resources explaining how to import data into R and if you are interested, we recommend you take a look at these; just search on the interweb.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c31">3.4</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Loading data in jamovi</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c51 c52">There are several different types of files that are likely to be relevant to us when doing data analysis. There are two in particular that are especially important from the perspective of this book:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_10-0 start"><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c10">jamovi files</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;are those with a .omv file extension. This is the standard kind of file that jamovi uses to store data, and variables and analyses.</span></li><li class="c39 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10 c51">Comma separated value (csv) files </span><span class="c51 c52">are those with a .csv file extension. These are just regular old text files and they can be opened with many different software programs. It&rsquo;s quite typical for people to store data in csv files, precisely because they&rsquo;re so simple.</span></li></ul><p class="c19"><span class="c51 c52">There are also several other kinds of data file that you might want to import into jamovi. For instance, you might want to open Microsoft Excel spreadsheets (.xls files), or data files that have been saved in the native file formats for other statistics software, such as SPSS or SAS. Whichever file formats you are using, it&rsquo;s a good idea to create a folder or folders especially for your jamovi data sets and analyses and to make sure you keep these backed up regularly.</span></p><p class="c30"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 245.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image303.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 245.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 3.3: The booksales.csv data file. On the left I&rsquo;ve opened the file using a spreadsheet program (OpenOffice), which shows that the file is basically a table. On the right the same file is open in a standard text editor (the TextEdit program on a Mac), which shows how the file is formatted. The entries in the table are wrapped in quote marks and separated by commas.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">3.4.1</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Importing data from csv files</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c0">One quite commonly used data format is the humble &ldquo;comma separated value&rdquo; file, also called a csv file, and usually bearing the file extension .csv. csv files are just plain old-fashioned text files and what they store is basically just a table of data. This is illustrated in Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">3.3</span><span class="c1 c0">, which shows a file called booksales.csv that I&rsquo;ve created. As you can see, each row represents the book sales data for one month. The first row doesn&rsquo;t contain actual data though, it has the names of the variables.</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s easy to open csv files in jamovi. From the top left menu (the button with three parallel lines) choose &lsquo;Open&rsquo; and browse to where you have stored the csv file on your computer. If you&rsquo;re on a Mac, it&rsquo;ll look like the usual Finder window that you use to choose a file; on Windows it looks like an Explorer window. An example of what it looks like on a Mac is shown in Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">3.4</span><span class="c51 c52">. I&rsquo;m assuming that you&rsquo;re familiar with your own computer, so you should have no problem finding the csv file that you want to import! Find the one you want, then click on the &ldquo;Open&rdquo; button.</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c51 c52">There are a few things that you can check to make sure that the data gets imported correctly:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_8-0 start"><li class="c53 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Heading. Does the first row of the file contain the names for each variable - a &lsquo;header&rsquo; row? The booksales.csv file has a header, so that&rsquo;s a yes.</span></li><li class="c66 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Separator. What character is used to separate different entries? In most csv files this will be a comma (it is &ldquo;comma separated&rdquo; after all).</span></li></ul><p class="c30"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 249.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image306.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 249.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 3.4: A dialog box on a Mac asking you to select the csv file jamovi should try to import. Mac users will recognize this immediately, it&rsquo;s the usual way in which a Mac asks you to find a file.

What character is used to specify the decimal point? In English speaking countries this is almost always a period (i.e.,). That&rsquo;s not universally true though, many European countries use a comma.</span></li><li class="c66 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Quote. What character is used to denote a block of text? That&rsquo;s usually going to be a double quote mark (&quot;). It is for the booksales.csv file.</span></li></ul><p class="c39"><span class="c31">3.5</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Importing unusual data files</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c51 c52">Throughout this book I&rsquo;ve assumed that your data are stored as a jamovi .omv file or as a &ldquo;properly&rdquo; formatted csv file. However, in real life that&rsquo;s not a terribly plausible assumption to make so I&rsquo;d better talk about some of the other possibilities that you might run into.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">3.5.1</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Loading data from text files</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c0">The first thing I should point out is that if your data are saved as a text file but aren&rsquo;t </span><span class="c10 c88">quite</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;in the proper csv format then there&rsquo;s still a pretty good chance that jamovi will be able to open it. You just need to try it and see if it works. Sometimes though you will need to change some of the formatting. The ones that I&rsquo;ve often found myself needing to change are:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_6-0 start"><li class="c53 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c58 c70 c45">header.</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;A lot of the time when you&rsquo;re storing data as a csv file the first row actually contains the column names and not data. If that&rsquo;s not true then it&rsquo;s a good idea to open up the csv file in a spreadsheet program such as Open Office and add the header row manually.</span></li><li class="c53 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c58 c70 c45">sep.</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;As the name &ldquo;comma separated value&rdquo; indicates, the values in a row of a csv file are usually separated by commas. This isn&rsquo;t universal, however. In Europe the decimal point is typically written as, instead of. and as a consequence, it would be somewhat awkward to use, as the separator. Therefore, it is not unusual to use; instead of, as the separator. At other times, I&rsquo;ve seen a TAB character used.</span></li><li class="c53 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c58 c70 c45">quote.</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;It&rsquo;s conventional in csv files to include a quoting character for textual data. As you can see by looking at the booksales.csv file, this is usually a double quote character, &quot;. But sometimes there is no quoting character at all, or you might see a single quote mark&rsquo; used instead.</span></li><li class="c53 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c58 c70 c45">skip. </span><span class="c51 c52">It&rsquo;s actually very common to receive CSV files in which the first few rows have nothing to do with the actual data. Instead, they provide a human readable summary of where the data came from, or maybe they include some technical info that doesn&rsquo;t relate to the data.</span></li><li class="c66 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c58 c70 c45">missing values.</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Often, you&rsquo;ll get given data with missing values. For one reason or another, some entries in the table are missing. The data file needs to include a &ldquo;special&rdquo; value to indicate that the entry is missing. By default, jamovi assumes that this value is 99</span><span class="c71">4</span><span class="c51 c52">, for both numeric and text</span></li></ul><hr><p class="c19 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c19"><img src="images/image5.png"><span class="c1 c34">&nbsp;You can change the default value for missing values in jamovi from the top right menu (three vertical dots), but this only works at the time of importing data files into jamovi. The default missing value in the dataset should not be a valid number associated with any of the variables, e.g. you could use -9999 as this is unlikely to be a valid value. </span></p><p class="c19 c40"><span class="c51 c52">data, so you should make sure that, where necessary,all missing values in the csv file are replace with 99 (or -9999; whichever you choose) before opening / importing the file into jamovi. Once you have opened / imported the file into jamovi all the missing values are converted to blank cells in the jamovi spreadsheet view.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">3.5.2</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Loading data from SPSS (and other statics packages)</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The commands listed above are the main ones we&rsquo;ll need for data files in this book. But in real life we have many more possibilities. For example, you might want to read data files in from other statistics programs. Since SPSS is probably the most widely used statistics package in psychology, it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that jamovi can also import SPSS data files (file extension .sav). Just follow the instructions above for how to open a csv file, but this time navigate to the .sav file you want to import. For SPSS files, jamovi will regard all values as missing if they are regarded as &ldquo;system missing&rdquo; files in SPSS. The &lsquo;Default missings&rsquo; value does not seem to work as expected when importing SPSS files, so be aware of this - you might need another step: import the SPSS file into jamovi, then export as a csv file before re-opening in jamovi</span><span class="c71">5</span><span class="c51 c52">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0">And that&rsquo;s pretty much it, at least as far as SPSS goes. As far as other statistical software goes, jamovi can also directly open / import SAS and STATA files.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">3.5.3</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Loading Excel files</span></p><p class="c66 c42"><span class="c51 c52">A different problem is posed by Excel files. Despite years of yelling at people for sending data to me encoded in a proprietary data format, I get sent a lot of Excel files. The way to handle Excel files is to open them up first in Excel or another spreadsheet program that can handle Excel files, and then export the data as a csv file before opening / importing the csv file into jamovi.</span></p><p class="c19 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c31">3.6</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Changing data from one level to another</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Sometimes you want to change the variable level. This can happen for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes when you import data from files, it can come to you in the wrong format. Numbers sometimes get imported as nominal, text values. Dates may get imported as text. ParticipantID values can sometimes be read as continuous: nominal values can sometimes be read as ordinal or even continuous. There&rsquo;s a good chance that sometimes you&rsquo;ll want to convert a variable from one measurement level into another one. Or, to use the correct term, you want to</span><span class="c0 c84">&nbsp;coerce</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;the variable from one class into another.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">In </span><span class="c0 c45">3.3</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;we saw how to specify different variable levels, and if you want to change a variable&rsquo;s</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">measurement level then you can do this in the jamovi data view for that variable.

These add-on modules have been developed by the jamovi community, i.e., jamovi users and developers who have created special software add-ons that do other, usually more advanced, analyses that go beyond the capabilities of the base jamovi program</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">To install add-on modules, just click on the large &ldquo;+&rdquo; in the top right of the jamovi window, select &ldquo;jamovi-library&rdquo; and then browse through the various add-on modules that are available. Choose the one(s) you want, and then install them, as in Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">3.5</span><span class="c0">. It&rsquo;s that easy. The newly installed modules can then be accessed from the &ldquo;Analyses&rdquo; button bar.

It&rsquo;s not hard, just close the program the same way you would any other program. However, what you might want to do before you quit is save your work! There are two parts to this: saving any changes to the data set, and saving the analyses that you ran.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c51 c52">It is good practice to save any changes to the data set as a new data set. That way you can always go back to the original data. To save any changes in jamovi, select &lsquo;Export&rsquo;... &lsquo;Data&rsquo; from the main jamovi menu (button with three horizontal bars in the top left) and create a new file name for the changed data set.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c51 c52">Alternatively, you can save both the changed data and any analyses you have undertaken by saving as a jamovi file. To do this, from the main jamovi menu select &lsquo;Save as&rsquo; and type in a file name for this &lsquo;jamovi file (.omv)&rsquo;. Remember to save the file in a location where you can find it again later. I usually create a new folder for specific data sets and analyses.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c31">3.9</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Summary</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c51 c52">Every book that tries to teach a new statistical software program to novices has to cover roughly the same topics, and in roughly the same order.

This is what </span><span class="c0 c102">descriptive statistics</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(as opposed to inferential statistics) is all about. In fact, </span><span>too</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;many people</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the term &ldquo;statistics&rdquo; is synonymous with descriptive statistics. It is this topic that we&rsquo;ll consider in this chapter, but before going into any details, let&rsquo;s take a moment to get a sense of why we need descriptive statistics. To do this, let&rsquo;s open the aflsmall_margins file and see what variables are stored in the file.</span></p><hr><p class="c6"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c57 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 309.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image308.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 309.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c57 c42"><span class="c0">Figure 4.1: A screenshot of jamovi showing the variables stored in the aflsmall margins.csv file</span></p><hr><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c0">In fact, there </span><span>are</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;just one variable here, </span><span class="c0 c7">afl.margins</span><span class="c0">.

Unlike most of the data sets in this book, this is actually real data, relating to the Australian Football League (AFL)</span><span class="c71">1</span><span class="c0">. The</span><span class="c0 c7">&nbsp;afl.margins</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;variable contains the winning margin (number of points) for all 176 home and away games played during the 2010 season.</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c0">This output doesn&rsquo;t make it easy to get a sense of what the data are actually saying. Just &ldquo;looking at the data&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a terribly effective way of understanding data. In order to get some idea about what the data are actually saying we need to calculate some descriptive statistics (this chapter) and draw some nice pictures (Chapter </span><span class="c0 c7">5</span><span class="c0">).

It&rsquo;s often extremely useful to try to condense the data into a few simple &ldquo;summary&rdquo; statistics. In most situations, the first thing that you&rsquo;ll want to calculate is a measure of </span><span class="c0 c84">central tendency</span><span class="c51 c52">. That is, you&rsquo;d like to know something about where the &ldquo;average&rdquo; or &ldquo;middle&rdquo; of your data lies. The three most commonly used measures are the mean, median and mode. I&rsquo;ll explain each of these in turn, and then discuss when each of them is useful.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c86 c55">4.1.1</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">The mean</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">The </span><span class="c0 c7">mean</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of a set of observations is just a normal, old-fashioned average. Add all of the values up, and then divide by the total number of values. The first five AFL winning margins were 56, 31, 56, 8</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and 32, so the mean of these observations is just:</span></p><p class="c64 c42"><img src="images/image20.png"></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">Of course, this definition of the mean isn&rsquo;t news to anyone. Averages (i.e., means) are used so often in everyday life that this is pretty familiar stuff. However, since the concept of a mean is something that everyone already understands, I&rsquo;ll use this as an excuse to start introducing some of the mathematical notation that statisticians use to describe this calculation, and talk about how the calculations would be done in jamovi.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">The first piece of notation to introduce is</span><span>&nbsp;N</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;which we&rsquo;ll use to refer to the number of observations that we&rsquo;re averaging (in this case</span><span>&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image21.png"><span class="c0">). Next, we need to attach a label to the observations themselves. It&rsquo;s traditional to u</span><span>se </span><img src="images/image11.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">for this, and to use subscripts to indicate which observation we&rsquo;re actually talking about. That is, we&rsquo;ll use</span><span>&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image9.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">to refer to the first observation,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image10.png"><span class="c0">to refer to the second observation, and so on all the way up to</span><span>&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image22.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;for the last one.

By tradition, we use </span><img src="images/image28.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">as the notation for the mean. So, the calculation for the mean could be expressed using the following formula:</span></p><p class="c57 c42"><img src="images/image29.png"></p><p class="c33"><span class="c0">This formula is entirely correct but it&rsquo;s terribly long, so we make use of the </span><span class="c0 c45">summation symbol</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image30.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">to shorten it</span><span class="c71">a</span><span class="c0">. If I want to add up the first five observations, I could write out the sum the long way, </span><img src="images/image31.png"><span class="c0">or I could use the summation symbol to shorten it to this:</span></p><p class="c57 c42"><img src="images/image32.png"></p><p class="c42 c134"><span class="c0">Taken literall</span><span class="c86">y, this could be read as &ldquo;the sum, taken over all i values from 1 to 5, of the value </span><img src="images/image23.png"><span class="c86">&rdquo;. But basically, what</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;it means is &ldquo;add up the first five observations&rdquo;. In any case, we can use this notation to write out the formula for the mean, which looks like this:</span></p><p class="c57 c42"><img src="images/image33.png"><img src="images/image34.png"></p><p class="c112 c42"><span class="c0">In all honesty, I can&rsquo;t imagine that all this mathematical notation helps clarify the concept of the mean at all. In fact, it&rsquo;s really just a fancy way of writing out the same thing I said in words: add all the values up and then divide by the total number of items. However, that&rsquo;s not really the reason I went into all that detail. My goal was to try to make sure that everyone reading this book is clear on the notation that we&rsquo;ll be using throughout the book:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image28.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;for the mean, </span><img src="images/image30.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;for the idea of summation, </span><img src="images/image23.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">for the </span><img src="images/image24.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">observation,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">and </span><span>N </span><span class="c0">for the total number of observations. We&rsquo;re going to be re-using these symbols a fair bit so it&rsquo;s important that you understand them well enough to be able to &ldquo;read&rdquo; the equations, and to be able to see that it&rsquo;s just saying &ldquo;add up lots of things and then divide by another thing&rdquo;.</span></p><hr><p class="c42 c23 c112"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c112 c42"><img src="images/image35.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c34">The choice to use &Sigma; to denote summation isn&rsquo;t arbitrary. It&rsquo;s the Greek upper case letter sigma, which is the analogue of the letter S in that alphabet. Similarly, there&rsquo;s an equivalent symbol used to denote the multiplication of lots of numbers, because multiplications are also called &ldquo;products&rdquo; we use the &Pi; symbol for this (the Greek upper case pi, which is the analogue of the letter P). </span></p><p class="c82 c42 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c82 c42 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c42 c23 c82"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c82 c42 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c82 c42"><span class="c86 c55">4.1.2</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Calculating the mean in jamovi</span></p><p class="c82 c42"><span class="c0">Okay, that&rsquo;s the math. So how do we get the magic computing box to do the work for us? When the number of observations starts to become large it&rsquo;s much easier to do these sorts of calculations using a computer.

The median of a set of observations is just the middle value. As before let&rsquo;s imagine we were interested only in the first </span><span>5</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;AFL winning margins: </span><span>56</span><span class="c0">, </span><span>31</span><span class="c0">, </span><span>56</span><span class="c0">, </span><span>8</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span>32</span><span class="c51 c52">. To figure out the median we sort these numbers into ascending order:</span></p><p class="c57 c42"><span class="c0">8, 31, </span><span class="c46">32</span><span class="c0">, 56, 56</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c0">From inspection, it&rsquo;s obvious that the median value of these</span><span>&nbsp;5 </span><span class="c0">observations are </span><span>32 </span><span class="c0">since that&rsquo;s the middle one in the sorted list (I&rsquo;ve put it in bold to make it even more obvious). Easy stuff. But what should we do if we are interested in the first </span><span>6 </span><span class="c0">games rather than the first </span><span>5 </span><span class="c0">? Since the sixth game in the season had a winning margin of </span><span>14 </span><span class="c0">points, our sorted list is now</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c57 c42"><span class="c0">8, 14, </span><span class="c46">31, 32</span><span class="c0">, 56, 56</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c112 c42"><span class="c0">and there are two middle numbers,</span><span>&nbsp;31 </span><span class="c0">and </span><span>32</span><span class="c0">. The median is defined as the average of those two numbers, which is of course </span><span>31.5 </span><span class="c0">. As before, it&rsquo;s very tedious to do this by hand when you&rsquo;ve got lots of numbers. In real life, of course, no-one actually calculates the median by sorting the data and then looking for the middle value. In real life we use a computer to do the heavy lifting for us, and jamovi has provided us with a Median value of </span><span>30.50</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for the </span><span class="c0 c7">afl.margins</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;variable (Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">4.3</span><span class="c51 c52">).</span></p><p class="c101 c42"><span class="c86 c55">4.1.4</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Mean or median? what is the difference?</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">Knowing how to calculate means and medians is only a part of the story. You also need to understand what each one is saying about the data, and what that implies for when you should use each one. This is illustrated in Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">4.4</span><span class="c51 c52">. The mean is kind of like the &ldquo;center of gravity&rdquo; of the data set, whereas the median is the &ldquo;middle value&rdquo; in the data. What this implies, as far as which one you should use, depends a little on what type of data you&rsquo;ve got and what you&rsquo;re trying to achieve. As a rough guide:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_4-0 start"><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">If your data are nominal scale, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t be using either the mean or the median. Both the mean and the median rely on the idea that the numbers assigned to values are meaningful. If the numbering scheme is arbitrary then it&rsquo;s probably best to use the mode (Section </span><span class="c52 c70 c45">4.1.6</span><span class="c51 c52">) instead.</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">If your data are ordinal scale, you&rsquo;re more likely to want to use the median than the mean. The median only makes use of the order information in your data (i.e., which numbers are bigger) but doesn&rsquo;t depend on the precise numbers involved. That&rsquo;s exactly the situation that applies when your data are ordinal scale. The mean, on the other hand, makes use of the precise numeric values assigned to the observations, so it&rsquo;s not really appropriate for ordinal data.</span></li><li class="c39 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">For interval and ratio scale data either one is generally acceptable. Which one you pick depends a bit on what you&rsquo;re trying to achieve. The mean has the advantage that it uses all the information in the data (which is useful when you don&rsquo;t have a lot of data). But it&rsquo;s very sensitive to extreme, outlying values.</span></li></ul><p class="c39"><span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s expand on that last part a little. One consequence is that there are systematic differences between the mean and the median when the histogram is asymmetric (skewed; see Section </span><span class="c0 c7">4.3</span><span class="c0">). This is illustrated in Figure </span><span class="c0 c7">4.4</span><span class="c0">. Notice that the median (right hand side) is located closer to the &ldquo;body&rdquo; of the histogram, whereas the mean (left hand side) gets dragged towards the &ldquo;tail&rdquo; (where the extreme values are). To give a concrete example, suppose Bob (income $50,000), Kate (income $60,000) and Jane (income $65,000) are sitting at a table. The average income at the table is $58,333 and the median income is $60,000. Then Bill sits down with them (income $100,000,000). The average income has now jumped to $25,043,750 but the median rises only to $62,500. If you&rsquo;re interested in looking at the overall income at the table the mean might be the right answer. But if you&rsquo;re interested in what counts as a typical income at the table the median would be a better choice here.</span></p><hr><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 296.54px; height: 257.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image309.png" style="width: 296.54px; height: 257.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 296.00px; height: 260.27px;"><img alt="" src="images/image310.png" style="width: 296.00px; height: 260.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Figure 4.4: An illustration of the difference between how the mean and the median should be interpreted. The mean is basically the &ldquo;center of gravity&rdquo; of the data set.

In contrast, the median is the middle observation, with half of the observations smaller and half of the observations larger.</span></p><hr><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c86 c55">4.1.5</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">A real life examples</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c0">To try to get a sense of why you need to pay attention to the differences between the mean and the median let&rsquo;s consider a real-life example. Since I tend to mock journalists for their poor scientific and statistical knowledge, I should give credit where credit is due. This is an excellent article on the ABC news website</span><img src="images/image3.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp; from 24 September, 2010:</span></p><p class="c25 c40"><span class="c34">Senior Commonwealth Bank executives have travelled the world in the past couple of weeks with a presentation showing how Australian house prices, and the key price to income ratios, compare favorably with similar countries. &ldquo;Housing affordability has actually been going sideways for the last five to six years,&rdquo; said Craig James, the chief economist of the bank&rsquo;s trading arm, CommSec.</span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span>&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image3.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c52 c70 c7">www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/24/3021480.htm</span></p><p class="c25 c23 c40"><span class="c1 c34"></span></p><p class="c25"><span>This probably comes as a huge surprise to anyone with a mortgage, or who wants a mortgage, or pays rent, or isn&rsquo;t completely oblivious to what&rsquo;s been going on in the Australian housing market over the last several years. Back to the article:</span></p><p class="c25 c40"><span class="c1 c34">CBA has waged its war against what it believes are housing doomsayers with graphs, numbers and international comparisons. In its presentation, the bank rejects arguments that Australia&rsquo;s housing is relatively expensive compared to incomes. It says Australia&rsquo;s house price to household income ratio of 5.6 in the major cities, and 4.3 nationwide, is comparable to many other developed nations. It says San Francisco and New York have ratios of 7, Auckland&rsquo;s is 6.7, and Vancouver comes in at 9.3.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">More excellent news! Except, the article goes on to make the observation that:</span></p><p class="c25 c40"><span class="c1 c34">Many analysts say that has led the bank to use misleading figures and comparisons. If you go to page four of CBA&rsquo;s presentation and read the source information at the bottom of the graph and table, you would notice there is an additional source on the international comparison &ndash; Demographic. However, if the Commonwealth Bank had also used Dermographia&#39;s analysis of Australia&rsquo;s house price to income ratio, it would have come up with a figure closer to 9 rather than 5.6 or 4.3</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">That&rsquo;s, um, a rather serious discrepancy. One group of people say 9, another says 4-5. Should we just split the difference and say the truth lies somewhere in between? Absolutely not! This is a situation where there is a right answer and a wrong answer. Dermographia is correct, and the Commonwealth Bank is wrong. As the article points out:</span></p><p class="c25 c40"><span class="c1 c34">[An] obvious problem with the Commonwealth Bank&rsquo;s domestic price to income figures is they compare average incomes with median house prices (unlike the Demographic figures that compare median incomes to median prices). The median is the mid-point, effectively cutting out the highs and lows, and that means the average is generally higher when it comes to incomes and asset prices, because it includes the earnings of Australia&rsquo;s wealthiest people. To put it another way: the Commonwealth Bank&rsquo;s figures count Ralph Norris&rsquo; multi-million dollar pay packet on the income side, but not his (no doubt) very expensive house in the property price figures, thus understating the house price to income ratio for middle-income Australians.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">Couldn&rsquo;t have put it better myself. The way that Demographic calculated the ratio is the right thing to do. The way that the Bank did it is incorrect. As for why an extremely quantitatively sophisticated organization such as a major bank made such an elementary mistake, well... I can&rsquo;t say for sure since I have no special insight into their thinking. But the article itself does happen to mention the following facts, which may or may not be relevant:</span></p><p class="c25 c40"><span class="c34">[A</span><span class="c79">s</span><span class="c1 c34">] Australia&rsquo;s largest home lender, the Commonwealth Bank has one of the biggest vested interests in house prices rising. It effectively owns a massive swathe of Australian housing as security for its home loans as well as many small business loans.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c86 c55">4.1.6</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Mode</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c0">The mode of a sample is very simple. It is the value that occurs most frequently. We can illustrate the mode using a different AFL variable: who has played in the most finals? Open the aflsmall_finalists file and take a look at the </span><span class="c0 c7">afl.finalists</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;variable, see Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">4.5</span><span class="c51 c52">. This variable contains the names of all 400 teams that played in all 200 finals matches played during the period 1987 to 2010.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c0">What we could do is read through all 400 entries and count the number of occasions on which each team name appears in our list of finalists, thereby producing a </span><span class="c0 c102">frequency table</span><span class="c0">. However, that would be mindless and boring: exactly the sort of task that computers are great at. So, let&rsquo;s use jamovi to do this for us. Under &lsquo;Exploration&rsquo; - &lsquo;Descriptive&rsquo; click the small check box labeled &lsquo;Frequency tables&rsquo; and you should get something like Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">4.6</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c0">Now that we have our frequency table, we can just look at it and see that, over the 24 years for which we have data, Geelong has played in more finals than any other team. Thus, the mode of the </span><span class="c0 c7">afl.finalists</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;data is </span><span class="c0 c7">&quot;Geelong&quot;</span><span class="c0">. We can see that Geelong (39 finals) played in more finals than any other team during the 1987-2010 period. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that in the &lsquo;Descriptives&rsquo; Table no results are calculated for Mean, Median, Minimum or Maximum. This is because the </span><span class="c0 c7">afl.finalists</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;variable is a nominal text variable so it makes no sense to calculate these values.</span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 297.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image312.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 297.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 4.5: A screenshot of jamovi showing the variables stored in the aflsmall finalists.csv file</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 377.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image313.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 377.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c0">Figure 4.6: A screenshot of jamovi showing the frequency table for the afl.finalists variable</span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c0">One last point to make regarding the mode. Whilst the mode is most often calculated when you have nominal data because means and medians are useless for those sorts of variables, there are some situations in which you really do want to know the mode of an ordinal, interval, or ratio scale variable. For instance, let&rsquo;s go back to our </span><span class="c0 c7">afl.margins</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;variable. This variable is clearly ratio scale (if it&rsquo;s not clear to you, it may help to re-read Section 2.2), and so in most situations, the mean or the median is the measure of central tendency that you want. But consider this scenario: a friend of yours is offering a bet and they pick a football game at random. Without knowing who is playing you have to guess the exact winning margin. If you guess correctly, you win $50. If you, don&rsquo;t you lose $1. There are no consolation prizes for &ldquo;almost&rdquo; getting the right answer. You have to guess exactly the right margin. For this bet, the mean and the median are completely useless to you. It is the mode that you should bet on. To calculate the mode for the </span><span class="c0 c7">afl.margins</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;variable in jamovi, go back to that data set, and on the &lsquo;Exploration&rsquo; - &lsquo;Descriptives&rsquo; screen you will see you can expand the section marked &lsquo;Statistics&rsquo;. Click on the checkbox marked &lsquo;Mode&rsquo; and you will see the modal value presented in the &lsquo;Descriptives&rsquo; Table, as in Figure 4.7. So, the 2010 data suggest you should bet on a 3-point margin.</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 388.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image316.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 388.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c0">Figure 4.7: A screenshot of jamovi showing the modal value for the afl.margins variable</span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c31">4.2</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Measures of variability</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c58"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c0">The statistics that we&rsquo;ve discussed so far all relate to central tendency.

However, </span><span>a </span><span class="c0">central tendency is not the only type of summary statistic that we want to calculate. The second thing that we really want is a measure of the variability of the data. That is, how &ldquo;spread out&rdquo; are the data? How &ldquo;far&rdquo; away from the mean or median do the observed values tend to be? For now, let&rsquo;s assume that the data are interval or ratio scale, and we&rsquo;ll continue to use the </span><span class="c0 c7">afl.margins</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;data. We&rsquo;ll use this data to discuss several different measures of spread, each with different strengths and weaknesses.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c86 c55">4.2.1</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Range</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">The </span><span class="c0 c102">range</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;of a variable is very simple. It&rsquo;s the biggest value minus the smallest value. For the AFL winning margins data the maximum value is 116 and the minimum value is 0. Although the range is the simplest way to quantify the notion of &ldquo;variability&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s one of the worst. Recall from our discussion of the mean that we want our summary measure to be robust. If the data set has one or two extremely bad values in it we&rsquo;d like our statistics to not be unduly influenced by these cases. For example, in a variable containing very extreme outliers</span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span class="c51 c52">-100, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c51 c52">it is clear that the range is not robust. This variable has a range of 110 but if the outlier were removed, we would have a range of only 8.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c86 c55">4.2.2</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Interquartile range</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">The </span><span class="c38">interquartile range</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(IQR) is like the range, but instead of the difference between the biggest and smallest value</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the difference between the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile is taken. If you don&rsquo;t already know what a </span><span class="c38">percentile</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is, the 10th percentile of a data set is the smallest number x such that 10% of the data is less than x. In fact, we&rsquo;ve already come across the idea. The median of a data set is its 50th percentile! In jamovi you can easily specify the 25th, 50th</span><span>,</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;and 75th percentiles by clicking the checkbox &lsquo;Quartiles&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Exploration&rsquo; - &lsquo;Descriptives&rsquo; - &lsquo;Statistics&rsquo; screen.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">And not surprisingly, in Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">4.8</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the 50th percentile is the same as the median value. And, by noting that 50.50 -12.75 = 37.75, we can see that the interquartile range for the 2010 AFL winning margins data is 37.75. While it&rsquo;s obvious how to interpret the range it&rsquo;s a little less obvious how to interpret the IQR. The simplest way to think about it is like this: the interquartile range is the range spanned by the &ldquo;middle half&rdquo; of the data. That is, one quarter of the data falls below the 25th percentile</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and one quarter of the data is above the 75</span><span class="c0 c71">th</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;percentile, leaving the &ldquo;middle half&rdquo; of the data lying in between the two. And the IQR is the range covered by that middle half.</span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 317.00px; height: 460.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image318.png" style="width: 317.00px; height: 460.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span class="c0">Figure 4.8: A screenshot of jamovi showing the Quartiles for the afl.margins variable</span></p><hr><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c86 c55">4.2.3</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Mean absolute deviation</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">The two measures we&rsquo;ve looked at so far, the range and the interquartile range, both rely on the idea that we can measure the spread of the data by looking at the percentiles of the data. However, this isn&rsquo;t the only way to think about the problem. A different approach is to select a meaningful reference point (usually the mean or the median) and then report the &ldquo;typical&rdquo; deviations from that reference point. What do we mean by &ldquo;typical&rdquo; deviation? Usually, this is the mean or median value of these deviations. In practice, this leads to two different measures: the &ldquo;mean absolute deviation&rdquo; (from the mean) and the &ldquo;median absolute deviation&rdquo; (from the median). From what I&rsquo;ve read, the measure based on the median seems to be used in statistics and does seem to be the better of the two. But to be honest I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen it used much in psychology. The measure based on the mean does occasionally show up in psychology though. In this section</span><span>,</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll talk about the first one, and I&rsquo;ll come back to talk about the second one later.</span></p><p class="c42 c118"><span class="c0">Since the previous paragraph might sound a little abstract, let&rsquo;s go through the </span><span class="c38">mean absolute deviation</span><span class="c88 c65">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">from the mean a little more slowly. One useful thing about this measure is that the name actually tells you exactly how to calculate it. Let&rsquo;s think about our AFL winning margins data, and once again we&rsquo;ll start by pretending that there are only 5 games in total, with winning margins of 56, 31, 56, 8 and 32. Since our calculations rely on an examination of the deviation from some reference point (in this case the mean), the first thing we need to calculate is the mean, </span><img src="images/image28.png"><span class="c0">. For these five observations, our mean is</span><span>&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image38.png"><span class="c0">. The next step is to convert each of our observations</span><span>&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image23.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;into a deviation score. We do this by calculating the difference between the observation</span><span>&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image23.png"><span class="c0">and the mean </span><img src="images/image28.png"><span class="c0">. That is, the deviation score is defined to be </span><img src="images/image39.png"><span class="c0">. For the first observation in our sample, this is equal to</span><span>&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image40.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">. Okay, that&rsquo;s simple enough. The next step in the process is to convert these deviations to absolute deviations, and we do this by converting any negative values to positive ones. Mathematically, we would denote the absolute value of</span><span>&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image41.png"><span class="c0">as</span><span>&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image42.png"><span class="c0">, and so, we say tha</span><span>t </span><img src="images/image43.png"><span class="c51 c52">. We use the absolute value here because we don&rsquo;t really care whether the value is higher than the mean or lower than the mean, we&rsquo;re just interested in how close it is to the mean. To help make this process as obvious as possible, the table below shows these calculations for all five observations:</span></p><p class="c118 c42 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><a id="t.9cb26f2cdb7142970b85a3824079114fc3677611"></a><a id="t.11"></a><table class="c87"><tbody><tr class="c11"><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">Which game </span></p><p class="c20"><img src="images/image44.png"></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">Value</span></p><p class="c20"><img src="images/image23.png"></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">deviation from mean</span></p><p class="c20"><img src="images/image39.png"></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">Absolute deviation</span></p><p class="c20"><img src="images/image45.png"></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">1</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">56</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">19.4</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">19.4</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">2</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">31</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">-5.6</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">5.6</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">3</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">56</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">19.4</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">19.4</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">4</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">8</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">-28.6</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">28.6</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">5</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">32</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">-4.6</span></p></td><td class="c54" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c20"><span class="c51 c52">4.6</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c64 c42 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c51 c52">Now that we have calculated the absolute deviation score for every observation in the data set, all that we have to do to calculate the mean of these scores.

First, we should really try to write down a proper mathematical formula. But in order do to this I need some mathematical notation to refer to the mean absolute deviation. Irritatingly, &ldquo;mean absolute deviation&rdquo; and &ldquo;median absolute deviation&rdquo; have the same acronym (MAD), which leads to a certain amount of ambiguity so I&rsquo;d better come up with something different for the mean absolute deviation. Sigh. What I&rsquo;ll do is use AAD instead, short for average absolute deviation. Now that we have some unambiguous notation, here&rsquo;s the formula that describes what we just calculated:</span></p><p class="c64 c42"><img src="images/image47.png"></p><p class="c39"><span class="c86 c55">4.2.4</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Variance</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Although the average absolute deviation measure has its uses, it&rsquo;s not the best measure of variability to use. From a purely mathematical perspective</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;there are some solid reasons to prefer squared deviations rather than absolute deviations. If we do that, we obtain a measure called the variance, which has a lot of really nice statistical properties that I&rsquo;m going to ignore</span><span class="c71">3</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and one massive psychological flaw that I&rsquo;m going to make a big deal out of in a moment. The variance of a data set </span><img src="images/image11.png"><span class="c0">is sometimes written as </span><img src="images/image48.png"><span class="c0">, but it&rsquo;s more commonly denoted</span><span>&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image49.png"><span class="c0">&nbsp;(the reason for this will become clearer shortly).</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">The formula that we use to calculate the variance of a set of observations is as follows:</span></p><p class="c57 c42"><img src="images/image50.png"></p><p class="c9"><span class="c51 c52">As you can see, it&rsquo;s basically the same formula that we used to calculate the average absolute deviation, except that instead of using &ldquo;absolute deviations&rdquo; we use &ldquo;squared deviations&rdquo;. It is for this reason that the variance is sometimes referred to as the &ldquo;mean square deviation&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c51 c52">Now that we&rsquo;ve got the basic idea, let&rsquo;s have a look at a concrete example. Once again, let&rsquo;s use the first five AFL games as our data. If we follow the same approach that we took last time, we end up with the following table:</span></p><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><hr><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33"><img src="images/image4.png"><span class="c79">&nbsp;Well, I will very briefly mention the one that I think is coolest, for a very particular definition of &ldquo;cool&rdquo;, that is. Variances are additive. Here&rsquo;s what that means. Suppose I have two variables &#x1d44b;&nbsp;and &#x1d44c;&nbsp;, whose variances are &#x1d449;&#x1d434;&#x1d445;(&#x1d44b;) and &#x1d449;&#x1d434;&#x1d445;(&#x1d44c;) respectively. Now imagine I want to define a new variable &#x1d44d; that is the sum of the two, &#x1d44d;=&#x1d44b;+&#x1d44c;. As it turns out, the variance of &#x1d44d;&nbsp;is equal to &nbsp;&#x1d449;&#x1d434;&#x1d445;(&#x1d44b;)+&#x1d449;&#x1d434;&#x1d445;(&#x1d44c;).

No, wait, you get a completely different answer (</span><img src="images/image53.png"><span class="c0">) - see Figure</span><span class="c0 c45">&nbsp;4.9</span><span class="c0">.

It&rsquo;s not a typo, and jamovi is not making a mistake. In fact, it&rsquo;s very simple to explain what jamovi is doing here, but slightly trickier to explain why jamovi is doing it. So, let&rsquo;s start with the &ldquo;what&rdquo;. What jamovi is doing is evaluating a slightly different formula to the one I showed you above. Instead of averaging the squared deviations, which requires you to divide by the number of data points N, jamovi has chosen to divide by </span><img src="images/image54.png"><span class="c51 c52">.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 647.07px; height: 104.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image275.png" style="width: 647.07px; height: 104.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">In other words, the formula that jamovi is using is this one:</span></p><p class="c64 c42"><img src="images/image55.png"></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">So that&rsquo;s the what. The real question is why jamovi is dividing by </span><img src="images/image54.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">and not by </span><img src="images/image56.png"><span class="c0">. After all, the variance is supposed to be the mean squared deviation, right? So, shouldn&rsquo;t we be dividing by</span><span>&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image56.png"><span class="c0">, the actual number of observations in the sample? Well, yes, we should. However, as we&rsquo;ll discuss in Chapter </span><span class="c88 c7">8</span><span class="c0">, there&rsquo;s a subtle distinction between &ldquo;describing a sample&rdquo; and &ldquo;making guesses about the population from which the sample came&rdquo;. Up to this point, it&rsquo;s been a distinction without a difference. Regardless of whether you&rsquo;re describing a sample or drawing inferences about the population, the mean is calculated exactly the same way. Not so for the variance, or the standard deviation, or for many other measures besides. What I outlined to you initially (i.e., take the actual average, and thus divide by</span><span>&nbsp;</span><img src="images/image56.png"><span class="c0">) assumes that you literally intend to calculate the variance of the sample. Most of the time, however, you&rsquo;re not terribly interested in the sample in and of itself. Rather, the sample exists to tell you something about the world. If so, you&rsquo;re actually starting to move away from calculating a &ldquo;sample statistic&rdquo; and towards the idea of estimating a &ldquo;population parameter&rdquo;. However, I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself. For now, let&rsquo;s just take it on faith that jamovi knows what it&rsquo;s doing, and we&rsquo;ll revisit the question later on when we talk about estimation in Chapter </span><span class="c0 c7">8</span><span class="c51 c52">.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">Okay, one last thing. This section so far has read a bit like a mystery novel. I&rsquo;ve shown you how to calculate the variance, described the weird &ldquo;</span><img src="images/image54.png"><span class="c0">&rdquo; thing that jamovi does and hinted at the reason why it&rsquo;s there, but I haven&rsquo;t mentioned the single most important thing. How do you </span><span class="c10 c88">interpret</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the variance? Descriptive statistics are supposed to describe things, after all, and right now the variance is really just a gibberish number. Unfortunately, the reason why I haven&rsquo;t given you the human-friendly interpretation of the variance is that there really isn&rsquo;t one. This is the most serious problem with the variance. Although it has some elegant mathematical properties that suggest that it really is a fundamental quantity for expressing variation, it&rsquo;s completely useless if you want to communicate with an actual human. Variances are completely uninterpretable in terms of the original variable! All the numbers have been squared and they don&rsquo;t mean anything anymore. This is a huge issue. For instance, according to the table I presented earlier, the margin in game 1 was &ldquo;376.36 points-squared higher than the average margin&rdquo;. This is exactly as stupid as it sounds, and so when we calculate a variance of 324.64 we&rsquo;re in the same situation. I&rsquo;ve watched a lot of footy games, and at no time has anyone ever referred to &ldquo;points squared&rdquo;. </span><hr></p><p class="c39"><img src="images/image5.png"><span class="c51 c52">With the possible exception of the third question.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c51 c52">It&rsquo;s not a real unit of measurement, and since the variance is expressed in terms of this gibberish unit, it is totally meaningless to a human.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c86 c55">4.2.5</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Standard Deviation</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Okay, suppose that you like the idea of using the variance because of those nice mathematical properties that I haven&rsquo;t talked about, but since you&rsquo;re a human and not a robot you&rsquo;d like to have a measure that is expressed in the same units as the data itself (i.e., points, not points squared). What should you do? The solution to the problem is obvious! Take the square root of the variance, known as the </span><span class="c50">standard deviation</span><span class="c51 c52">, also called the &ldquo;root mean squared deviation&rdquo;, or RMSD. This solves our problem fairly neatly. Whilst nobody has a clue what &ldquo;a variance of 324.68 points-squared&rdquo; really means, it&rsquo;s much easier to understand &ldquo;a standard deviation of 18.01 points&rdquo; since it&rsquo;s expressed in the original units. It is traditional to refer to the standard deviation of a sample of data as s, though &ldquo;sd&rdquo; and &ldquo;std dev.&rdquo; are also used at times.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 671.03px; height: 192.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image254.png" style="width: 671.03px; height: 192.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c51 c52">Because the standard deviation is equal to the square root of the variance, you probably won&rsquo;t be surprised to see that the formula is:</span></p><p class="c57 c42"><img src="images/image57.png"></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">and in jamovi there is a check box for &lsquo;Std. deviation&rsquo; right above the check box for &lsquo;Variance&rsquo;.

Because the standard deviation is derived from the variance, and the variance is a quantity that has little to no meaning that makes sense to us humans, the standard deviation doesn&rsquo;t have a simple interpretation. As a consequence, most of us just rely on a simple rule of thumb. In general, you should expect 68% of the data to fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean, 95% of the data to fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean, and 99.7% of the data to fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean. This rule tends to work pretty well most of the time, but it&rsquo;s not exact. It&rsquo;s actually calculated based on an assumption that the histogram is symmetric and &ldquo;bell shaped&rdquo;.</span><span class="c71">5</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;As you can tell from looking at the AFL winning margins histogram in Figure 4.2, this isn&rsquo;t exactly true of our data! Even so, the rule is approximately correct. As it turns out, 65.3% of the AFL margins data fall within one standard deviation of the mean. This is shown visually in Figure 4.10.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c86 c55">4.2.6</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Which measure to use?</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c51 c52">We&rsquo;ve discussed quite a few measures of spread: range, IQR, mean absolute deviation, variance and standard deviation; and hinted at their strengths and weaknesses. Here&rsquo;s a quick summary:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_3-0 start"><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c10">Range</span><span class="c51 c52">. Gives you the full spread of the data. It&rsquo;s very vulnerable to outliers and as a consequence it isn&rsquo;t often used unless you have good reasons to care about the extremes in the data.</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c10">Interquartile range</span><span class="c51 c52">. Tells you where the &ldquo;middle half&rdquo; of the data sits. It&rsquo;s pretty robust and complements the median nicely. This is used a lot.</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c10">Mean absolute deviation</span><span class="c51 c52">. Tells you how far &ldquo;on average&rdquo; the observations are from the mean. It&rsquo;s very interpretable but has a few minor issues (not discussed here) that make it less attractive to statisticians than the standard deviation. Used sometimes, but not often.</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c10">Variance</span><span class="c51 c52">. Tells you the average squared deviation from the mean. It&rsquo;s mathematically elegant and is probably the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to describe variation around the mean, but it&rsquo;s completely uninterpretable because it doesn&rsquo;t use the same units as the data. Almost never used except as a mathematical tool, but it&rsquo;s buried &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo; of a very large number of statistical tools.</span></li><li class="c19 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c10">Standard deviation</span><span class="c51 c52">. This is the square root of the variance. It&rsquo;s fairly elegant mathematically and it&rsquo;s expressed in the same units as the data so it can be interpreted pretty well. In situations where the mean is the measure of central tendency, this is the default. This is by far the most popular measure of variation.</span></li></ul><p class="c39"><span class="c0">In short, the IQR and the standard deviation are easily the two most common measures used to report the variability of the data. But there are situations in which the others are used. I&rsquo;ve described all of them in this book because there&rsquo;s a fair chance, you&rsquo;ll run into most of these somewhere.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c31">4.3</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Skew and kurtosis</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c0">There are two more descriptive statistics that you will sometimes see reported in the psychological literature: skew and kurtosis. In practice, neither one is used anywhere near as frequently as the measures of central tendency and variability that we&rsquo;ve been talking about. Skew is pretty important, so you do see it mentioned a fair bit, but I&rsquo;ve actually never seen kurtosis reported in a scientific article to date.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image7.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Strictly, the assumption is that the data are normally distributed, which is an important concept that we&rsquo;ll discuss more in Chapter 7 and will turn up over and over again later in the book.</span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 184.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image321.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 184.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 4.11: An illustration of skewness.

Skewness is basically a measure of asymmetry and the easiest way to explain it is by drawing some pictures. As Figure 4.11 illustrates, if the data tend to have a lot of extreme small values (i.e., the lower tail is &ldquo;longer&rdquo; than the upper tail) and not so many extremely large values (left panel) then we say that the data are negatively skewed. On the other hand, if there are more extremely large values than extremely small ones (right panel) we say that the data are positively skewed. That&rsquo;s the qualitative idea behind skewness. If there are relatively more values that are far greater than the mean, the distribution is positively skewed or right skewed, with a tail stretching to the right. Negative or left skew is the opposite. A symmetric distribution has a skewness of 0. The skewness value for a positively skewed distribution is positive, and a negative value for a negatively skewed distribution.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 645.00px; height: 149.97px;"><img alt="" src="images/image273.png" style="width: 645.00px; height: 149.97px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c0">One formula for the skewness of a data set is as follows</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><img src="images/image61.png"></p><p class="c33"><span class="c0">where </span><img src="images/image56.png"><span class="c0">is the number of observations, </span><img src="images/image28.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">is the sample mean, and </span><img src="images/image59.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">is the standard deviation (the &ldquo;divide by </span><img src="images/image54.png"><span class="c51 c52">&rdquo; Version, that is).</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Perhaps more helpfully, you can use jamovi to calculate skewness: it&rsquo;s a check box in the &lsquo;Statistics&rsquo; options under &lsquo;Exploration&rsquo; - &lsquo;Descriptives&rsquo;. For the afl.margins variable, the skewness figure is 0.780. If you divide the skewness estimate by the Std. error for skewness you have an indication of how skewed the data is. Especially in small samples (N&iexcl;50), one rule of thumb suggests that a value of 2 or less can mean that the data is not very skewed, and a value of over 2 that there is sufficient skew in the data to possibly limit its use in some statistical analyses. Though there is no clear agreement on this interpretation. That said, this does indicate that the AFL winning margins data is somewhat skewed (0.780 / 0.183 = 4.262).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The final measure that is sometimes referred to, though very rarely in practice, is the </span><span class="c38">kurtosis</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of a data set. Put simply, kurtosis is a measure of the &ldquo;pointiness&rdquo; of a data set, as illustrated in Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">4.12</span><span class="c0">. By convention, we say that the &ldquo;normal curve&rdquo; (black lines) has zero kurtosis, so the pointiness of a data set is assessed relative to this curve.</span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 174.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image322.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 174.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c0">Figure 4.12: An illustration of kurtosis.

In the middle we have a </span><span class="c10 c88">mesokurtic</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;data set (kurtosis is almost exactly 0) which means that the pointiness of the data is just about right. Finally, on the right, we have a </span><span class="c10 c88">leptokurtic</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;data set (kurtosis = 2.12) indicating that the data set is &ldquo;too pointy&rdquo;.

The data on the right are too pointy, so the kurtosis is positive and we say that the data is leptokurtic.

It looks a bit stupid, just sticking a &ldquo;-3&rdquo; at the end of the formula, but there are good mathematical reasons for doing this.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c51 c52">More to the point, jamovi has a check box for kurtosis just below the check box for skewness, and this gives a value for kurtosis of 0.101 with a standard error of 0.364.

This is pretty easy to do in jamovi. For instance, let&rsquo;s say I want to look at the descriptive statistics for some </span><span class="c0 c7">clin.trial</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;data, broken down separately by </span><span class="c0 c7">therapy</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;type. This is a new data set, one that you&rsquo;ve never seen before.

Let&rsquo;s load it and see what we&rsquo;ve got:</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c0">Evidently there were three drugs: a placebo, something called </span><span class="c10 c88">anxifree</span><span class="c10">,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and something called </span><span class="c10 c88">joyzepam</span><span class="c51 c52">, and there were 6 people administered each drug. There were 9 people treated using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and 9 people who received no psychological treatment. And we can see from looking at the &lsquo;Descriptives&rsquo; of the mood.gain variable that most people did show a mood gain (mean = &nbsp;0.88), though without knowing what the scale is here it&rsquo;s hard to say much more than that. Still, that&rsquo;s not too bad. Overall, I feel that I learned something from that.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c0">We can also go ahead and look at some other descriptive statistics, and this time separately for each type of therapy.

It is possible to do this by adding another variable, drug, into the &lsquo;Split by&rsquo; box. Easy peasy, though sometimes if you split too much there isn&rsquo;t enough data in each breakdown combination to make meaningful calculations.

If there is a plus sign (i.e. 6.51e+4 then the decimal point is moved to the right, i.e. 65,100.00.

The survey has 50 questions which you can answer in a grumpy way or not. Across a big sample (hypothetically, let&rsquo;s imagine a million people or so!) the data are fairly normally distributed, with the mean grumpiness score being 17 out of 50 questions answered in a grumpy way, and the standard deviation is 5. In contrast, when I take the questionnaire, I answer 35 out of 50 questions in a grumpy way. So, how grumpy am I? One way to think about it would be to say that I have grumpiness of 35/50, so you might say that I&rsquo;m 70% grumpy. But that&rsquo;s a bit weird, when you think about it. If my friend had phrased her questions a bit differently people might have answered them in a different way, so the overall distribution of answers could easily move up or down depending on the precise way in which the questions were asked. So, I&rsquo;m only 70% grumpy with respect to this set of survey questions. Even if it&rsquo;s a very good questionnaire this isn&rsquo;t very an informative statement.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c51 c52">A simpler way around this is to describe my grumpiness by comparing me to other people. Shockingly, out of my friend&rsquo;s sample of 1,000,000 people, only 159 people were as grumpy as me (that&rsquo;s not at all unrealistic, frankly) suggesting that I&rsquo;m in the top 0.016% of people for grumpiness. This makes much more sense than trying to interpret the raw data. This idea, that we should describe my grumpiness in terms of the overall distribution of the grumpiness of humans, is the qualitative idea that standardization attempts to get at. One way to do this is to do exactly what I just did and describe everything in terms of percentiles. However, the problem with doing this is that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s lonely at the top&rdquo;. Suppose that my friend had only collected a sample of 1000 people (still a pretty big sample for the purposes of testing a new questionnaire, I&rsquo;d like to add), and this time got, let&rsquo;s say, a mean of 16 out of 50 with a standard deviation of 5. The problem is that almost certainly not a single person in that sample would be as grumpy as me.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">However, all is not lost. A different approach is to convert my grumpiness score into a </span><span class="c50">standard score</span><span class="c0">, also referred to as a z-score. The standard score is defined as the number of standard deviations above the mean that my grumpiness score lies. To phrase it in &ldquo;pseudo-math&rdquo; the standard score is calculated like this:</span></p><p class="c64 c42"><img src="images/image63.png"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 667.00px; height: 96.03px;"><img alt="" src="images/image261.png" style="width: 667.00px; height: 96.03px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c51 c52">In actual maths, the equation for the z-score is</span></p><p class="c57 c42"><img src="images/image64.png"></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">So, going back to the grumpiness data, we can now transform Dani&rsquo;s raw grumpiness into a standardized grumpiness score.</span></p><p class="c64 c42"><img src="images/image65.png"></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">To interpret this value, recall the rough heuristic that I provided in Section </span><span class="c0 c7">4.2.5</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;in which I noted that 99.7% of values are expected to lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean. So, the fact that my grumpiness corresponds to a z score of 3.6 indicates that I&rsquo;m very grumpy indeed. In fact, this suggests that I&rsquo;m grumpier than 99.98% of people. Sounds about right.</span></p><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">In addition to allowing you to interpret a raw score in relation to a larger population (and thereby allowing you to make sense of variables that lie on arbitrary scales), standard scores serve a second useful function. Standard scores can be compared to one another in situations where the raw scores can&rsquo;t. Suppose, for instance, my friend also had another questionnaire that measured extraversion using a 24 item questionnaire. The overall mean for this measure turns out to be 13 with </span><span>a </span><span class="c0">standard deviation 4, and I scored a 2. As you can imagine, it doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense to try to compare my raw score of 2 on the extraversion questionnaire to my raw score of 35 on the grumpiness questionnaire. The raw scores for the two variables are &ldquo;about&rdquo; fundamentally different things, so this would be like comparing apples to oranges. What about the standard scores?</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Well, this is a little different. If we calculate the standard scores we get </span><img src="images/image65.png"><span>&nbsp; for grumpiness and,</span><img src="images/image66.png"><span>, for extraversion. These two numbers can be compared to each other</span><span class="c71">7</span><span>.I&rsquo;m much less extroverted than most people (</span><img src="images/image67.png"><span>) and much grumpier than most people (</span><img src="images/image68.png"><span>).</span><span class="c51 c52">But the extent of my unusualness is much more extreme for grumpiness since 3.6 is a bigger number than 2.75. Because each standardized score is a statement about where an observation falls relative to its own population, it is possible to compare standardized scores across completely different variables.</span></p><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><hr><p class="c9 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c9"><img src="images/image18.png"><span class="c1 c34">&nbsp;Though some caution is usually warranted. It&rsquo;s not always the case that one standard deviation on variable A corresponds to the same &ldquo;kind&rdquo; of thing as one standard deviation on variable B.

In this chapter, we talked about the following topics:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c10">Measures of central tendency</span><span class="c51 c52">. Broadly speaking, central tendency measures tell you where the data are. There are three measures that are typically reported in the literature: the mean, median and mode. (Section </span><span class="c52 c70 c45">4.1</span><span class="c51 c52">)</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c10">Measures of variability</span><span class="c51 c52">. In contrast, measures of variability tell you about how &ldquo;spread out&rdquo; the data are. The key measures are: range, standard deviation, and interquartile range. (Section </span><span class="c52 c70 c45">4.2</span><span class="c51 c52">)</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c10">Measures of skewness and kurtosis</span><span class="c51 c52">. We also looked at asymmetry in a variable&rsquo;s distribution (skew) and pointiness (kurtosis). (Section </span><span class="c52 c70 c45">4.3</span><span class="c51 c52">)</span></li><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c10">Getting group summaries of variables in jamovi</span><span class="c51 c52">. Since this book focuses on doing data analysis in jamovi, we spent a bit of time talking about how descriptive statistics are computed for different subgroups.

Everyone loves a pretty picture, right? But before we do, I want to end on an important point. A traditional first course in statistics spends only a small proportion of the class on descriptive statistics, maybe one or two lectures at most. The vast majority of the lecturer&rsquo;s time is spent on inferential statistics because that&rsquo;s where all the hard stuff is. That makes sense, but it hides the practical everyday importance of choosing good descriptives. With that in mind. . .</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c66 c42 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c19 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c86 c55">4.6.1</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Epilogue: Good descriptive statistics are descriptive!</span></p><p class="c48 c42"><span class="c51 c10">The death of one man is a tragedy. </span></p><p class="c48 c42"><span class="c51 c10">The death of millions is a statistic. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c48 c42"><span class="c1 c18 c63">Josef Stalin, Potsdam 1945</span></p><p class="c17 c23"><span class="c1 c18 c63"></span></p><p class="c48 c42"><span class="c37 c76">950,000 &ndash; 1,200,000 </span></p><p class="c48 c42"><span class="c37 c76">Estimate of Soviet repression deaths, </span></p><p class="c48 c42"><span class="c18 c63 c81">1937-1938 </span><span class="c18 c63">(Ellman 2010)</span></p><p class="c17 c23"><span class="c1 c18 c63"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Stalin&rsquo;s infamous quote about the statistical character of the deaths of millions is worth giving some thought. The clear intent of his statement is that the death of an individual touches us personally and its force cannot be denied, but that the deaths of a multitude are incomprehensible and as a consequence are mere statistics and more easily ignored. I&rsquo;d argue that Stalin was half right. A statistic is an abstraction, a description of events beyond our personal experience, and so hard to visualize. Few if any of us can imagine what the deaths of millions is &ldquo;really&rdquo; like, but we can imagine one death and this gives the lone death it</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span class="c51 c52">s feeling of immediate tragedy, a feeling that is missing from Ellman&rsquo;s cold statistical description.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c51 c52">Yet it is not so simple. Without numbers, without counts, without a description of what happened, we have no chance of understanding what really happened, no opportunity even to try to summon the missing feeling. And in truth, as I write this sitting in comfort on a Saturday morning half a world and a whole lifetime away from the Gulags, when I put the Ellman estimate next to the Stalin quote a dull dread settles in my stomach and a chill settle over me. The Stalinist repression is something truly beyond my experience, but with a combination of statistical data and those recorded personal histories that have come down to us, it is not entirely beyond my comprehension. Because what Ellman&rsquo;s numbers tell us is this: over a two-year period, Stalinist repression wiped out the equivalent of every man, woman and child currently alive in the city where I live. Each one of those deaths had its own story, was its own tragedy, and only some of those are known to us now. Even so, with a few carefully chosen statistics, the scale of the atrocity starts to come into focus.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c51 c52">Thus, it is no small thing to say that the first task of the statistician and the scientist is to summarize the data, to find some collection of numbers that can convey to an audience a sense of what has happened. This is the job of descriptive statistics, but it&rsquo;s not a job that can be told solely using the numbers. You are a data analyst, and not a statistical software package. Part of your job is to take these statistics and turn them into a description. When you analyze data, it is not sufficient to list off a collection of numbers. Always remember that what you&rsquo;re really trying to do is communicate with a human audience. The numbers are important, but they need to be put together into a meaningful story that your audience can interpret. That means you need to think about framing. You need to think about context. And you need to think about the individual events that your statistics are summarizing.</span></p><h1 class="c111 c42 c128"><span class="c52 c78 c96"></span></h1><h1 class="c111 c42"><span class="c24">5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c24">Drawing graphs</span></h1><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c48 c42"><span class="c37 c76">Above all else show the data.</span></p><p class="c48 c42"><span class="c18 c88 c81">Edward Tufte</span><span class="c18 c71">1</span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">Visualizing data is one of the most important tasks facing the data analyst. It&rsquo;s important for two distinct but closely related reasons. Firstly, there&rsquo;s the matter of drawing &ldquo;presentation graphics&rdquo;, displaying your data in a clean, visually appealing fashion makes it easier for your reader to understand what you&rsquo;re trying to tell them. Equally important, perhaps even more important, is the fact that drawing graphs </span><span>help</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;you to understand the data. To that end, it&rsquo;s important to draw &ldquo;exploratory graphics&rdquo; that help you learn about the data as you go about analyzing it. These points might seem pretty obvious but I cannot count the number of times I&rsquo;ve seen people forget them.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">To give a sense of the importance of this chapter, I want to start with a classic illustration of just how powerful a good graph can be. To that end, Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">5.1</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;shows a redrawing of one of the most famous data visualizations of all time. This is John Snow&rsquo;s 1854 map of cholera deaths. The map is elegant in its simplicity. In the background</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;we have a street map </span><span>that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;helps orient the viewer. Over the top</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;we see a large number of small dots, each one representing the location of a cholera case. The larger symbols show the location of water pumps, </span><span>labeled</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;by name. Even the most casual inspection of the graph makes it very clear that the source of the outbreak is almost certainly the Broad Street pump. Upon viewing this graph Dr</span><span>.</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Snow arranged to have the handle removed from the pump and ended the outbreak that had killed over 500 people. Such is the power of a good data visualization.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">The goals in this chapter are twofold. First, to discuss several fairly standard graphs that we use a lot when analyzing and presenting data, and second to show you how to create these graphs in jamovi. The graphs themselves tend to be pretty straightforward, so in one respect this chapter is pretty simple. Where people usually struggle is learning how to produce graphs, and especially learning how to produce good graphs. Fortunately, learning how to draw graphs in jamovi is reasonably simple as long as you&rsquo;re not too picky about what your graph looks like. What I mean when I say this is that jamovi has a lot of very good default graphs or plots, that most of the time produce a clean, high-quality graphic. However, on those occasions when you do want to do something non-standard, or if you need to make highly specific changes to the figure, then the graphics functionality in jamovi is not yet capable of supporting advanced work or detail editing.</span><hr><img src="images/image2.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;The origin of this quote is Tufte&rsquo;s lovely book The Visual Display of Quantitative Information.</span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 370.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image285.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 370.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c0">Figure 5.1: A stylized redrawing of John Snow&rsquo;s original cholera map.

Histograms are one of the simplest and most useful ways of visualizing data. They make </span><span>the </span><span class="c0">most sense when you have an interval or ratio scale variable (e.g., the </span><span class="c0 c45">afl.margins</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;data from Chapter </span><span class="c0 c45">4</span><span class="c0">) and what you want to do is get an overall impression of the variable. Most of you probably know how histograms work, since they&rsquo;re so widely used, but for the sake of completeness</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll describe them. All you do is divide up the possible values into </span><span class="c0 c84">bins</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and then count the number of observations that fall within each bin. This count is referred to as the frequency or density of the bin and is displayed as a vertical bar. Ihe AFL winning margins data there are 33 games in which the winning margin was less than 10 points and it is this fact that is represented by the height of the leftmost bar that we showed earlier in Chapter </span><span class="c0 c45">4</span><span class="c0">, Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">4.2</span><span class="c0">. With these earlier graphs</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;we used an advanced plotting package in R which, for now, is beyond the capability of jamovi. But jamovi gets us close, and drawing this histogram in jamovi is pretty straightforward. Open up the &lsquo;plots&rsquo; options under &lsquo;Exploration&rsquo; - &lsquo;Descriptives&rsquo; and click the &lsquo;histogram&rsquo; check box, as in Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">5.2</span><span class="c0">. jamovi defaults to labeling the y-axis as &lsquo;density&rsquo; and the x-axis with the variable name. The </span><span class="c0 c84">bins</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are selected automatically, and there is no scale, or count, information on the y-axis unlike the previous Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">4.2</span><span class="c0">. But this does not matter too much because after all</span><span>&nbsp;that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;we are really interested in is our impression of the shape of the distribution: is it normally distributed or is there a skew or kurtosis? Our first impressions of these characteristics come from drawing a </span><span class="c38">histogram</span><span class="c51 c52">.</span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 379.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image286.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 379.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span class="c0">Figure 5.2: jamovi screen showing the histogram check box</span><hr></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">One additional feature that jamovi provides is the ability to plot a &lsquo;Density&rsquo; curve. You can do this by clicking the &lsquo;Density&rsquo; check box under the &lsquo;Plots&rsquo; options (and unchecking &lsquo;Histogram&rsquo;), and this gives us the plot shown in Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">5.3</span><span class="c0">. A density plot visualizes the distribution of data over a continuous interval or time period. This chart is a variation of a histogram that uses </span><span class="c38">kernel smoothing</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;to plot values, allowing for smoother distributions by smoothing out the noise. The peaks of a density plot help display where values are concentrated over the interval. An advantage density plots have over histograms is that they are better at determining the distribution shape because they&rsquo;re not affected by the number of bins used (each bar used in a typical histogram). A histogram comprising of only 4 bins wouldn&rsquo;t produce a distinguishable enough shape of distribution as a 20-bin histogram would. However, with density plots, this isn&rsquo;t an issue.</span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 468.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image289.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 468.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span class="c0">Figure 5.3: A density plot of the </span><span class="c0 c45">afl.margins</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;variable plotted in jamovi</span><hr></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Although this image would need a lot of cleaning up in order to make a good presentation graphic (i.e., one you&rsquo;d include in a report), it nevertheless does a pretty good job of describing the data.

The downside to histograms is that they aren&rsquo;t very compact. Unlike some of the other plots</span><span>,</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll talk about it&rsquo;s hard to cram 20-30 histograms into a single image without overwhelming the viewer.

The idea behind a boxplot is to provide a simple visual depiction of the median, the interquartile range, and the range of the data. And because they do so in a fairly compact way boxplots have become a very popular statistical graphic, especially during the exploratory stage of data analysis when you&rsquo;re trying to understand the data yourself. Let&rsquo;s have a look at how they work, again using the afl.margins data as our example.</span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 362.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image291.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 362.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span class="c0">Figure 5.4: A box plot of the afl.margins variable plotted in jamovi</span><hr></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">The easiest way to describe what a boxplot looks like is just to draw one. Click on the &lsquo;Box plot&rsquo; check box and you will get the plot shown on the lower right of Figure 5.4. jamovi has drawn the most basic boxplot possible. When you look at this plot this is how you should interpret it: the thick line in the middle of the box is the median; the box itself spans the range from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and the &ldquo;whiskers&rdquo; go out to the most extreme data point that doesn&rsquo;t exceed a certain bound. By default, this value is 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR), calculated as 25th percentile - (1.5*IQR) for the lower boundary, and 75th percentile + (1.5*IQR) for the upper boundary. Any observation whose value falls outside this range is plotted as a circle or dot instead of being covered by the whiskers and is commonly referred to as an </span><span class="c0 c84">outlier</span><span class="c0">. For our AFL margins data</span><span>,</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;there are two observations that fall outside this range, and these observations are plotted as dots (the upper boundary is 107, and looking over the data column in the spreadsheet there are two observations with values higher than this, 108 and 116, so these are the dots).</span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c86 c55">5.2.1</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Violin plots</span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 480.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image292.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 480.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 5.5: A violin plot of the afl.margins variable plotted in jamovi, also showing a box plot and data points</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">A variation to the traditional box plot is the violin plot. Violin plots are similar to box plots except that they also show the kernel probability density of the data at different values. Typically, violin plots will include a marker for the median of the data and a box indicating the interquartile range, as in standard box plots. In jamovi you can achieve this sort of functionality by checking both the &lsquo;Violin&rsquo; and the &rsquo;Box plot&rsquo; check boxes. See Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">5.5</span><span class="c51 c52">, which also has the &lsquo;Data&rsquo; check box turned on to show the actual data points on the plot. This does tend to make the graph a bit too busy though, in my opinion. Clarity is simplicity, so in practice it might be better to just use a simple box plot.</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c86 c55">5.2.2</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Drawing multiple boxplots</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">One last thing. What if you want to draw multiple boxplots at once? Suppose, for instance, I wanted separate boxplots showing the AFL margins not just for 2010 but for every year between 1987 and 2010. To do that the first thing we&rsquo;ll have to do is find the data. These are stored in the aflsmall2.csv file. So, let&rsquo;s load it into jamovi and see what is in it. You will see that it is a pretty big data set. It contains 4296 games and the variables that we&rsquo;re interested in. What we want to do is have jamovi draw boxplots for the margin variable, but plotted separately for each year. The way to do this is to move the year variable across into the &lsquo;Split by&rsquo; box, as in Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">5.6</span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 233.03px;"><img alt="" src="images/image293.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 233.03px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 5.6: jamovi screen shot showing the &lsquo;Split by&rsquo; window</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">The result is shown in Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">5.7</span><span class="c51 c52">. This version of the box plot, split by year, gives a sense of why it&rsquo;s sometimes useful to choose box plots instead of histograms. It&rsquo;s possible to get a good sense of what the data look like from year to year without getting overwhelmed with too much detail. Now imagine what would have happened if I&rsquo;d tried to cram 24 histograms into this space: no chance at all that the reader is going to learn anything useful.</span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 534.00px; height: 161.03px;"><img alt="" src="images/image294.png" style="width: 534.00px; height: 161.03px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 5.7: Multiple boxplots plotted in jamovi, for the margin by year variables in the aflsmall2 data set</span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c86 c55">5.2.3</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">Using box plots to detect outliers</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">Because the boxplot automatically separates out those observations that lie outside a certain range, depicting them with a dot in jamovi, people often use them as an informal method for detecting </span><span class="c0 c84">outliers</span><span class="c0">: observations that are &ldquo;suspiciously&rdquo; distant from the rest of the data. Here&rsquo;s an example. Suppose that I&rsquo;d drawn the boxplot for the AFL margins data and it came up looking like Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">5.8</span><span class="c0">. It&rsquo;s pretty clear that something funny is going on with two of the observations. Apparently, there were two games in which the margin was over 300 points! That doesn&rsquo;t sound right to me. Now that I&rsquo;ve become suspicious it&rsquo;s time to look a bit more closely at the data. In jamovi you can quickly find out which of these observations are suspicious and then you can go back to the raw data to see if there has been a mistake in data entry. To do this you need to set up a filter so that only those observations with values over a certain threshold are included. In our example, the threshold is over 300, so that is the filter we will create. First, click on the &lsquo;Filters&rsquo; button at the top of the jamovi window, and then type &lsquo;margin &#261; 300&rsquo; into the filter field, as in Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">5.9</span><span class="c51 c52">.</span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 197.03px;"><img alt="" src="images/image295.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 197.03px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 5.9: the jamovi filter screen</span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 207.03px;"><img alt="" src="images/image296.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 207.03px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 5.10: Frequency table for ID showing the ID numbers for the two suspicious outliers: 14 and 134</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c51 c52">This filter creates a new column in the spreadsheet view where only those observations that pass the filter are included. One neat way to quickly identify which observations these are is to tell jamovi to produce a &lsquo;Frequency table&rsquo; (in the &lsquo;Exploration&rsquo; - &lsquo;Descriptives&rsquo; window) for the ID variable (which must be a nominal variable otherwise the Frequency table is not produced). In Figure 5.10 you can see that the ID values for the observations where the margin was over 300 are 14 and 134. These are suspicious cases, or observations, where you should go back to the original data source to find out what is going on.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c51 c52">Usually, you find that someone has just typed in the wrong number. Whilst this might seem like a silly example, I should stress that this kind of thing actually happens a lot. Real world data sets are often riddled with stupid errors, especially when someone had to type something into a computer at some point. In fact, there&rsquo;s actually a name for this phase of data analysis and in practice it can take up a huge chunk of our time: data cleaning. It involves searching for typing mistakes (&ldquo;typos&rdquo;), missing data and all sorts of other obnoxious errors in raw data files.</span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 480.00px; height: 474.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image251.png" style="width: 480.00px; height: 474.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c64 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 5.8: A boxplot showing two very suspicious outliers!</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">For less extreme values, even if they are flagged in a boxplot as outliers, the decision about whether to include outliers or exclude them in any analysis depends heavily on why you think the data look the way they do and what you want to use the data for. You need to exercise good judgement here. If the outlier looks legitimate to you, then keep it. In any case, I&rsquo;ll return to the topic again in Section </span><span class="c0 c45">12.10</span><span class="c51 c52">.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c31">5.3</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Bar graphs</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Another form of </span><span>a </span><span class="c0">graph that you often want to plot is the bar graph. Let&rsquo;s use the afl.finalists data set with the afl.finalists variable that I introduced in Section 4.1.6. What I want to do is draw a bar graph that displays the number of finals that each team has played in over the time spanned by the afl.finalists data set. There are lots of teams, but I am particularly interested in just four: Brisbane, Carlton, Fremantle</span><span>,</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;and Richmond. So, the first step is to set up a filter so just those four teams are included in the bar graph. This is straightforward in jamovi and you can do it by using the &lsquo;Filters&rsquo; function that we used previously. Open up the &lsquo;Filters&rsquo; screen and type in the following:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">afl.finalists == &lsquo;Brisbane&rsquo; or afl.finalists == &lsquo;Carlton&rsquo; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">or afl.finalists == &lsquo;Fremantle&rsquo; or afl.finalists == &lsquo;Richmond&rsquo;</span><span class="c71">2</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">When you have done this, you will see, in the &lsquo;Data&rsquo; view, that jamovi has filtered out all values apart from those we have specified. Next, open up the &lsquo;Exploration&rsquo; - &lsquo;Descriptives&rsquo; window and click on the &lsquo;Bar plot&rsquo; check box (remember to move the &lsquo;afl.finalists&rsquo; variable across into the &lsquo;Variables&rsquo; box so that jamovi knows which variable to use). You should then get a bar graph, something like that shown in Figure </span><span class="c0 c45">5.11.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c52 c70 c45"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c31">5.4</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Saving image files using jamovi</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Hold on, you might be thinking.

Every time I write a new scientific paper one of the first things I do is sit down and think about what the pictures will be. In my head</span><span>,</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;an article is just a sequence of pictures linked together by a story. All the rest of it is just window dressing. What I&rsquo;m trying to say here is that the human visual system is a very powerful data analysis tool. Give it the right kind of information and it will supply a human reader with a massive amount of knowledge very quickly. Not for nothing do we have the saying &ldquo;a picture is worth a thousand words&rdquo;. With that in mind, I think that this is one of the most important chapters in the book. The topics covered were:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_list_1-0 start"><li class="c17 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c10">Common plots</span><span class="c51 c52">. Much of the chapter was focused on standard graphs that statisticians like to produce: histograms (Section </span><span class="c52 c70 c45">5.1</span><span class="c51 c52">), boxplots (Section </span><span class="c52 c70 c45">5.2</span><span class="c51 c52">)</span><span>,</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;and bar graphs (Section </span><span class="c52 c70 c45">5.3</span><span class="c51 c52">)</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c10">Saving image files</span><span class="c51 c52">.

Whilst jamovi produces some really neat default graphics, editing the plots is currently not possible. For more advanced graphics and plotting capability</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the packages available in R are much more powerful. One of the most popular graphics systems is provided by the ggplot2 package (see </span><span class="c0 c45">http://ggplot2.org/</span><span class="c0">), which is loosely based on &ldquo;The grammar of graphics&rdquo; (</span><span class="c0 c45">Wilkinson, Wills, Rope, Norton, and Dubbs 2006</span><span class="c51 c52">). It&rsquo;s not for novices. You need to have a pretty good grasp of R before you can start using it, and even then, it takes a while to really get the hang of it. But when you&rsquo;re ready it&rsquo;s worth taking the time to teach yourself, because it&rsquo;s a much more powerful and cleaner system.</span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><h1 class="c111 c42" id="h.gdyxgu3fslrh"><span class="c24">6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c24">Pragmatic matters</span></h1><p class="c39 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c42 c124"><span class="c51 c10">The garden of life never seems to confine itself to the plots philosophers have laid out for its convenience.

My goal in this chapter is to talk a bit more honest about the realities of working with data than you&rsquo;ll see anywhere else in the book. The problem with real-world data sets is that they are messy. Very often the data file that you start with doesn&rsquo;t have the variables stored in the right format for the analysis you want to do. Sometimes there might be a lot of missing values in your data set. Sometimes you only want to analyse a subset of the data. Et cetera. In other words, there&rsquo;s a lot of </span><span class="c61">data manipulation</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;that you need to do just to get the variables in your data set into the format that you need it. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a basic introduction to these pragmatic topics. Although the chapter is motivated by the kinds of practical issues that arise when manipulating real data, I&rsquo;ll stick with the practice that I&rsquo;ve adopted through most of the book and rely on very small, toy data sets that illustrate the underlying issue. Because this chapter is essentially a collection of techniques and doesn&rsquo;t tell a single coherent story, it may be useful to start with a list of topics: </span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_anbgpkin19pu-0 start"><li class="c42 c22 c101 li-bullet-0"><span>Section </span><span class="c7">6.1.</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Tabulating data. </span></li><li class="c101 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span>Section </span><span class="c7">6.2.</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Using logical expressions.</span></li><li class="c101 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span>Section </span><span class="c7">6.3.</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Transforming or recoding a variable.</span></li><li class="c101 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span>Section </span><span class="c7">6.4.</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Some useful mathematical functions. </span></li><li class="c101 c42 c22 li-bullet-0"><span>Section </span><span class="c7">6.5.</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Extracting a subset of a data set.</span></li></ul><p class="c73 c42"><span class="c51 c52">As you can see, the list of topics that the chapter covers is pretty broad, and there&rsquo;s a lot of content there. Even though this is one of the longest and hardest chapters in the book, I&rsquo;m only scratching the surface of several fairly different and important topics. My advice, as usual, is to read through the chapter once and try to follow as much of it as you can. Don&rsquo;t worry too much if you can&rsquo;t grasp it all at once, especially the later sections. The rest of the book is only lightly reliant on this chapter so you can get away with just understanding the basics. However, what you&rsquo;ll probably find is that later on, you&rsquo;ll need to flick back to this chapter to understand some of the concepts that I refer to here.</span></p><hr><p class="c73 c42 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c73 c42"><img src="images/image2.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;The quote comes from Home is the Hangman, published in 1975.</span></p><p class="c73 c42 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c65">6.1</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Tabulating and cross-tabulating data</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">A very common task when analysing data is the construction of frequency tables or crosstabulation of one variable against another.

A logical value is an assertion about whether something is true or false. This is implemented in jamovi in a pretty straightforward way. There are two logical values, namely TRUE and FALSE. Despite the simplicity, logical values are very useful things. Let&rsquo;s see how they work.</span></p><p class="c4 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">6.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assessing matheatical truths</span></p><p class="c4"><span>In George Orwell&rsquo;s classic book 1984 one of the slogans used by the totalitarian Party was &ldquo;two plus two equals five&rdquo;. The idea being that the political domination of human freedom becomes complete when it is possible to subvert even the most basic of truths. It&rsquo;s a terrifying thought, especially when the protagonist Winston Smith finally breaks down under torture and agrees to the proposition. &ldquo;Man is infinitely malleable&rdquo;, the book says. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that this isn&rsquo;t true of humans</span><img src="images/image3.png"><span>&nbsp;and it&rsquo;s definitely not true of jamovi. jamovi is not infinitely malleable, it has rather firm opinions on the topic of what is and isn&rsquo;t true, at least as regards basic mathematics. If I ask it to calculate </span><img src="images/image69.png"><img src="images/image4.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;, it always gives the same answer, and it&rsquo;s not bloody 5!</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Of course, so far jamovi is just doing the calculations. I haven&rsquo;t asked it to explicitly assert that </span><img src="images/image70.png"><span>&nbsp;is a true statement. If I want jamovi to make an explicit judgement, I can use a command like this: </span><img src="images/image70.png"></p><p class="c4"><span>What I&rsquo;ve done here is use the </span><span class="c61">equality operator</span><span>, ==, to force jamovi to make a &ldquo;true or false&rdquo; judgement.</span><img src="images/image5.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Okay, let&rsquo;s see what jamovi thinks of the Party slogan, so type this into the compute new variable &lsquo;formula&rsquo; box:</span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image71.png"></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0">And what do you get? It should be a whole set of &lsquo;false&rsquo; values in the spreadsheet column for your newly computed variable. Booyah! Freedom and ponies for all! Or something like that.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Anyway, it was worth having a look at what happens if I try to force jamovi to believe that two plus two is five by making a statement like </span><img src="images/image72.png"><span>. I know that if I do this in another program, say R, then it throws up an error message. But wait, if you do this in jamovi you get a whole set of &lsquo;false&rsquo; values. So what is going on? Well, it seems that jamovi is being pretty smart and realises that you are testing whether it is TRUE or FALSE that </span><img src="images/image72.png"><span>, regardless of whether you use the correct </span><span class="c61">equality operator</span><span>,</span><img src="images/image73.png"><span>, or the equals sign &ldquo;</span><img src="images/image74.png"><span class="c51 c52">&rdquo;.</span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image3.png"><span class="c1 c34">&nbsp;I offer up my teenage attempts to be &ldquo;cool&rdquo; as evidence that some things just can&rsquo;t be done. </span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image4.png"><span class="c1 c34">&nbsp;You can do this in the Compute new variable screen, though just calculating 2 + 2 for every cell of a new variable is not very useful!</span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image5.png"><span class="c79">&nbsp;Note that this is a very different operator to the equals operator =. A common typo that people make when trying to write logical commands in jamovi (or other languages, since the &ldquo;= versus ==&rdquo; distinction is important in many computer and statistical programs) is to accidentally type = when you really mean ==. Be especially cautious with this, I&rsquo;ve been programming in various languages since I was a teenager and I still screw this up a lot. Hmm. I think I see why I wasn&rsquo;t cool as a teenager. And why I&rsquo;m still not cool.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">6.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logical operations</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">So now we&rsquo;ve seen logical operations at work. But so far we&rsquo;ve only seen the simplest possible example. You probably won&rsquo;t be surprised to discover that we can combine logical operations with other operations and functions in a more complicated way, like this:</span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image75.png"></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">Or this</span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image76.png"></p><p class="c25"><span>Not only that, but as Table </span><span class="c7">6.1</span><span>&nbsp;illustrates, there are several other logical operators that you can use corresponding to some basic mathematical concepts. Hopefully these are all pretty selfexplanatory. For example, the </span><span class="c61">less than</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;operator &lt; checks to see if the number on the left is less than the number on the right. If it&rsquo;s less, then jamovi returns an answer of TRUE, but if the two numbers are equal, or if the one on the right is larger, then jamovi returns an answer of FALSE.</span></p><p class="c25"><span>In contrast, the</span><span class="c65">&nbsp;</span><span class="c61">less than or equal</span><span>&nbsp;to operator &lt;= will do exactly what it says. It returns a value of TRUE if the number of the left hand side is less than or equal to the number on the right hand side. At this point I hope it&rsquo;s pretty obvious what the </span><span class="c61">greater than</span><span>&nbsp;operator &gt; and the</span><span class="c102">&nbsp;</span><span class="c61">greater than or equal</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;to operator &gt;= do!</span></p><p class="c25"><span>Next on the list of logical operators is the</span><span class="c65">&nbsp;</span><span class="c61">not equal</span><span>&nbsp;to operator != which, as with all the others, does what it says it does. It returns a value of TRUE when things on either side are not identical to each other. Therefore, since </span><img src="images/image69.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t equal to 5, we would get &lsquo;true&rsquo; as the value for our newly computed variable. Try it and see: </span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image77.png"></p><p class="c25"><span>We&rsquo;re not quite done yet. There are three more logical operations that are worth knowing about, listed in Table </span><span class="c7">6.2</span><span>. These are the not operator !, the and operator and, and the or operator or. Like the other logical operators, their behaviour is more or less exactly what you&rsquo;d expect given their names. For instance, if I ask you to assess the claim that &ldquo;either </span><img src="images/image70.png"><span>&nbsp;or </span><img src="images/image72.png"><span>&rdquo; you&rsquo;d say that it&rsquo;s true. Since it&rsquo;s an &ldquo;either-or&rdquo; statement, all we need is for one of the two parts to be true. That&rsquo;s what the or operator does:</span><img src="images/image7.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image7.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c79">Now, here&rsquo;s a quirk in jamovi. When you have simple logical expressions like the ones we have already met, e.g. 2 + 2 == 5 then jamovi neatly states &lsquo;false&rsquo; (or &lsquo;true&rsquo;) in the corresponding spreadsheet column. Underneath the hood, jamovi stores &lsquo;false&rsquo; as 0 and &lsquo;true&rsquo; as 1. When we have more complex logical expressions, such as (2+2 == 4) or (2+2 == 5), then jamovi just displays either 0 or 1, depending whether the logical expression is evaluated as false, or true.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><a id="t.c5dff7709df0fc3317752c6780d68f6a9ccc9f9d"></a><a id="t.15"></a><table class="c74"><tbody><tr class="c11"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">operation</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">operator</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">example input</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">answer</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">less than</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image78.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image79.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">TRUE</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">less than or equal to</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image80.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image81.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">TRUE</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">greater than</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image6.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image82.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">FALSE</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">greater than or equal to</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image83.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image84.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">TRUE</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">equal to</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image73.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image85.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">FALSE</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">not equal to</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image86.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image87.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">TRUE</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Table 6.1: Some logical operators.

No shades of grey are allowed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Of course, in our </span><img src="images/image72.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;example, we didn&rsquo;t really need to use the &ldquo;not&rdquo; operator NOT and the &ldquo;equals to&rdquo; operator == as two separate operators. We could have just used the &ldquo;not equals to&rdquo; operator != like this:</span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image94.png"></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">6.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applying logical operations to text</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">I also want to briefly point out that you can apply these logical operators to text as well as to logical data. It&rsquo;s just that we need to be a bit more careful in understanding how jamovi interprets the different operations. In this section I&rsquo;ll talk about how the equal to operator == applies to text, since this is the most important one. Obviously, the not equal to operator != gives the exact opposite answers to == so I&rsquo;m implicitly talking about that one too, but I won&rsquo;t give specific commands showing the use of !=.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Okay, let&rsquo;s see how it works. In one sense, it&rsquo;s very simple. For instance, I can ask jamovi if the word &quot;cat&quot; is the same as the word &quot;dog&quot;, like this:</span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image95.png"></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">That&rsquo;s pretty obvious, and it&rsquo;s good to know that even jamovi can figure that out. Similarly, jamovi does recognise that a &quot;cat&quot; is a &quot;cat&quot;:</span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image96.png"></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">Again, that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;d expect. However, what you need to keep in mind is that jamovi is not at all tolerant when it comes to grammar and spacing. If two strings differ in any way whatsoever, jamovi will say that they&rsquo;re not equal to each other, as with the following:</span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image96.png"></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image97.png"></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image98.png"></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">You can also use other logical operators too. For instance jamovi also allows you to use the &lt; and &gt; operators to determine which of two text &lsquo;strings&rsquo; comes first, alphabetically speaking. Sort of. Actually, it&rsquo;s a bit more complicated than that, but let&rsquo;s start with a simple example:</span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image99.png"></p><p class="c4"><span>In jamovi, this example evaluates to &lsquo;true&rsquo;. This is because </span><span class="c7">&quot;cat&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;does does come before </span><span class="c7">&quot;dog&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;alphabetically, so jamovi judges the statement to be true. However, if we ask jamovi to tell us if &quot;cat&quot; comes before </span><span class="c7">&quot;anteater&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;then it will evaluate the expression as false. So far, so good. But text data is a bit more complicated than the dictionary suggests. What about </span><span class="c7">&quot;cat&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c7">&quot;CAT&quot;</span><span class="c51 c52">? Which of these comes first? Try it and find out:</span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image100.png"></p><p class="c4"><span>This in fact evaluates to &lsquo;true&rsquo;. In other words, jamovi assumes that uppercase letters come before lowercase ones. Fair enough. No-one is likely to be surprised by that. What you might find surprising is that jamovi assumes that all uppercase letters come before all lowercase ones. That is, while </span><span class="c7">&quot;anteater&quot; &lt; &quot;zebra&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;is a true statement, and the uppercase equivalent </span><span class="c7">&quot;ANTEATER&quot; &lt; &quot;ZEBRA&quot;</span><span>&nbsp;is also true, it is not true to say that </span><span class="c7">&quot;anteater&quot; &lt; &quot;ZEBRA&quot;</span><span class="c51 c52">, as the following extract illustrates. Try this:</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c51 c52">! &quot; # $ % &amp; &rsquo; ( ) * + , - . / 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; &lt; = &gt; ? @ A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z [ \ ] ^ _ &lsquo; a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z } | { </span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Table 6.3: The ordering of various text characters used by the &lt; and &gt; operators.

For instance, it&rsquo;s often convenient to take a continuous-valued variable (e.g., age) and break it up into a smallish number of categories (e.g., younger, middle, older). At other times, you may need to convert a numeric variable into a different numeric variable (e.g., you may want to analyse at the absolute value of the original variable). In this section I&rsquo;ll describe a few key ways you can do these things in jamovi.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">6.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a transformed variable</span></p><p class="c4"><span>The first trick to discuss is the idea of </span><span class="c102">transforming</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;a variable. Taken literally, anything you do to a variable is a transformation, but in practice what it usually means is that you apply a relatively simple mathematical function to the original variable in order to create a new variable that either (a) provides a better way of describing the thing you&rsquo;re actually interested in, or (b) is more closely in agreement with the assumptions of the statistical tests you want to do. Since, at this stage, I haven&rsquo;t talked about statistical tests or their assumptions, I&rsquo;ll show you an example based on the first case. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Suppose I&rsquo;ve run a short study in which I ask 10 people a single question: </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">On a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), to what extent do you agree with the proposition that &ldquo;Dinosaurs are awesome&rdquo;?</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Now let&rsquo;s load and look at the data. The data file likert.omv contains a single variable that contains raw Likert-scale responses for these 10 people. However, if you think about it, this isn&rsquo;t the best way to represent these responses. Because of the fairly symmetric way that we set up the response scale, there&rsquo;s a sense in which the midpoint of the scale should have been coded as 0 (no opinion), and the two endpoints should be `3 (strongly agree) and &acute;3 (strongly disagree). By recoding the data in this way it&rsquo;s a bit more reflective of how we really think about the responses. The recoding here is pretty straightforward, we just subtract 4 from the raw scores. In jamovi you can do this by computing a new variable: click on the &lsquo;Data&rsquo; - &lsquo;Compute&rsquo; button and you will see that a new variable has been added to the spreadsheet. Let&rsquo;s call this new variable </span><span class="c7">likert.centred</span><span>&nbsp;(go ahead and type that in) and then add the following in the formula box, like in Figure </span><span class="c7">6.5</span><span class="c51 c52">: &lsquo;likert.raw - 4&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 627.00px; height: 575.03px;"><img alt="" src="images/image278.png" style="width: 627.00px; height: 575.03px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 6.5: Creating a new computed variable in jamovi</span></p><p class="c4"><span>One reason why it might be useful to have the data in this format is that there are a lot of situations where you might prefer to analyse the strength of the opinion separately from the direction of the opinion. We can do two different transformations on this</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;likert.centred</span><span>&nbsp;variable in order to distinguish between these two different concepts. First, to compute an </span><span class="c7">opinion. strength</span><span>&nbsp;variable, we want to take the absolute value of the centred data (using the &lsquo;ABS&rsquo; function).</span><img src="images/image17.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;</span></p><hr><p class="c4 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4"><img src="images/image17.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero, regardless of whether it&rsquo;s sign is negative or positive. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>In jamovi, create another new variable using the &lsquo;Compute&rsquo; button.

This shows the different &lsquo;Functions&rsquo; and &lsquo;Variables&rsquo; that you can add to the &lsquo;Formula&rsquo; box, so double click on &lsquo;ABS&rsquo; and then double click on &ldquo;likert.centred&rsquo; and you will see that the &lsquo;Formula&rsquo; box is populated with ABS(likert.centred) and a new variable has been created in the spreadsheet view, as in Figure </span><span class="c52 c70 c7">6.6</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 627.07px; height: 490.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image260.png" style="width: 627.07px; height: 490.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 6.6: Using the fx button to select functions and variables</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span>Second, to compute a variable that contains only the direction of the opinion and ignores the strength, we want to calculate the &lsquo;sign&rsquo; of the variable. In jamovi we can use the </span><span class="c7">IF</span><span>&nbsp;function to do this. Create another new variable using the &lsquo;Compute&rsquo; button, name this one </span><span class="c7">opinion.sign</span><span class="c51 c52">, and then type the following into the function box: <br></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c52 c70 c7">IF(likert.centred == 0, 0, likert.centred / opinion.strength) </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">When done, you&rsquo;ll see that all negative numbers from the likert.centred variable are converted to &acute;1, all positive numbers are converted to 1 and zero stays as 0, like so: </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">-1 1 -1 0 0 0 -1 1 1 1</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Let&rsquo;s break down what this &lsquo;IF&rsquo; command is doing. In jamovi there are three parts to an &lsquo;IF&rsquo; statement, written as &rsquo;IF(expression, value, else)&rsquo;. The first part, &lsquo;expression&rsquo; can be a logical or mathematical statement. In our example, we have specified &lsquo;likert.centred == 0&rsquo;, which is TRUE for values where likert.centred is zero. The next part, &lsquo;value&rsquo;, is the new value where the expression in part one is TRUE. In our example, we have said that for all those values where likert.centred is zero, keep them zero. In the next part, &lsquo;else&rsquo;, we can enter another logical or mathematical statement to be used if part one evaluates to FALSE, i.e. where likert.centred is not zero. In our example we have divided likert.centred by opinion.strength to give &lsquo;-1&rsquo; or &lsquo;+1&rsquo; depending of the sign of the original value in likert.centred</span><img src="images/image18.png"><span class="c51 c52">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>And we&rsquo;re done. We now have three shiny new variables, all of which are useful transformations of the original </span><span class="c7">likert.raw</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;data.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">6.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collapsing a number into a smaller number of discrete levels or categories</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">One pragmatic task that comes up quite often is the problem of collapsing a variable into a smaller number of discrete levels or categories. For instance, suppose I&rsquo;m interested in looking at the age distribution of people at a social gathering:</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">60,58,24,26,34,42,31,30,33,2,9</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">In some situations it can be quite helpful to group these into a smallish number of categories. For example, we could group the data into three broad categories: young (0-20), adult (21-40) and older (41-60). This is a quite coarse-grained classification, and the labels that I&rsquo;ve attached only make sense in the context of this data set (e.g., viewed more generally, a 42 year old wouldn&rsquo;t consider themselves as &ldquo;older&rdquo;). We can slice this variable up quite easily using the jamovi &lsquo;IF&rsquo; function that we have already used. This time we have to specify nested &lsquo;IF&rsquo; statements, meaning simply that IF the first logical expression is TRUE, insert a first value, but IF a second logical expression is TRUE, insert a second value, but IF a third logical expression is TRUE, then insert a third value. This can be written as:</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">IF(Age &gt;= 0 and Age &lt;= 20, 1, </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">IF(Age &gt;= 21 and Age &lt;= 40, 2, </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">IF(Age &gt;= 41 and Age &lt;= 60, 3 ))) </span></p><p class="c25"><span>Note that there are three left parentheses used during the nesting, so the whole statement has to end with three right parentheses otherwise you will get an error message. The jamovi screen shot for this data manipulation, along with an accompanying frequency table, is shown in Figure </span><span class="c52 c70 c7">6.7</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c52 c70 c7"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c52 c70 c7"></span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c0 c7 c13"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c52 c70 c7"></span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image18.png"><span>&nbsp;The reason we have to use the &lsquo;IF&rsquo; command and keep zero as zero is that you cannot just use likert.centred / opinion.strength to calculate the sign of likert.centred, because mathematically dividing zero by zero does not work. Try it and see</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c52 c70 c7"></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 627.07px; height: 725.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image276.png" style="width: 627.07px; height: 725.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 6.7: Collapsing a variable into a smaller number of discrete levels using the jamovi &lsquo;IF&rsquo; function</span></p><p class="c4"><span>It&rsquo;s important to take the time to figure out whether or not the resulting categories make any sense at all in terms of your research project. If they don&rsquo;t make any sense to you as meaningful categories, then any data analysis that uses those categories is likely to be just as meaningless. More generally, in practice I&rsquo;ve noticed that people have a very strong desire to carve their (continuous and messy) data into a few (discrete and simple) categories, and then run analyses using the categorised data instead of the original data.</span><img src="images/image19.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as to say that this is an inherently bad idea, but it does have some fairly serious drawbacks at times, so I would advise some caution if you are thinking about doing it. </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">6.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collapsing a number into a smaller number of discrete levels or categories</span></p><p class="c25"><span>Sometimes you want to apply the same transformation to more than one variable, for example when you have multiple questionnaire items that all need to be recalculated or recoded in the same way. And one of the neat features in jamovi is that you can create a transformation, using the &lsquo;Data&rsquo; - &lsquo;Transform&rsquo; button, that can then be saved and applied to multiple variables. Let&rsquo;s go back to the first example above, using the data file likert.omv that contains a single variable with raw Likert-scale responses for 10 people. To create a transformation that you can save and then apply across multiple variables (assuming you had more variables like this in your data file), first in the spreadsheet editor select (i.e., click) the variable you want to use to initially create the transformation. In our example this is likert.raw. Next click the &lsquo;Transform&rsquo; button in the jamovi &lsquo;Data&rsquo; ribbon, and you&rsquo;ll see something like Figure </span><span class="c52 c70 c7">6.8.</span></p><p class="c25"><span>Give your new variable a name, let&rsquo;s call it opinion.strength and then click on the &lsquo;using transform&rsquo; selection box and select &lsquo;Create New Transform...&rsquo;. This is where you will create, and name, the transformation that can be re-applied to as many variables as you like. The transformation is automatically named for us as &lsquo;Transform 1&rsquo; (imaginative, huh. You can change this if you like). Then type the expression &ldquo;</span><span class="c7">ABS($source - 4)</span><span>&rdquo; into the function text box, as in Figure </span><span class="c7">6.9</span><span>, press Enter or Return on your keyboard and, hey presto, you have created a new transformation and applied it to the </span><span class="c7">likert.raw</span><span>&nbsp;variable! Good, eh. Note that instead of using the variable label in the expression, we have instead used &lsquo;</span><span class="c7">$source</span><span>&rsquo;. This is so that we can then use the same transformation with as many different variables as we like - jamovi requires you to use &lsquo;</span><span class="c7">$source</span><span class="c51 c52">&rsquo; to refer to the source variable you are transforming. Your transformation has also been saved and can be re-used any time you like (providing you save the dataset as an &lsquo;.omv&rsquo; file, otherwise you&rsquo;ll lose it!).</span></p><p class="c25"><span>You can also create a transformation with the second example we looked at, the age distribution of people at a social gathering. Go on, you know you want to! Remember that we collapsed this variable into three groups: younger, adult and older. This time we will achieve the same thing, but using the jamovi &lsquo;Transform&rsquo; - &lsquo;Add condition&rsquo; button. With this data set (go back to it or create it again if you didn&rsquo;t save it) set up a new variable transformation. Call the transformed variable </span><span class="c7">AgeCats</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;and the transformation you will create Agegroupings. Then click on the big &ldquo;+&rdquo; sign next to the function box.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image19.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ve read further into the book, and are re-reading this section, then a good example of this would be someone choosing to do an ANOVA using AgeCats as the grouping variable, instead of running a regression using Age as a predictor. There are sometimes good reasons for doing this. For instance, if the relationship between Age and your outcome variable is highly non-linear and you aren&rsquo;t comfortable with trying to run non-linear regression! However, unless you really do have a good rationale for doing this, it&rsquo;s best not to. It tends to introduce all sorts of other problems (e.g., the data will probably violate the normality assumption) and you can lose a lot of statistical power. </span></p><p class="c25"><span>&nbsp;This is the &lsquo;Add condition&rsquo; button and I&rsquo;ve stuck a big red arrow onto Figure </span><span class="c7">6.10</span><span>&nbsp;so you can see exactly where this is.

What&rsquo;s more, the Agegroupings transformation has been saved and can be re-applied any time you like. Ok, so I know that it&rsquo;s unlikely you will have more than one &lsquo;Age&rsquo; variable, but you get the idea now of how to set up transformations in jamovi, so you can follow this idea with other sorts of variables. A typical scenario for this is when you have a questionnaire scale with, say, 20 items (variables) and each item was originally scored from 1 to 6 but, for some reason or quirk of the data you decide to recode all the items as 1 to 3. You can easily do this in jamovi by creating and then re-applying your transformation for each variable that you want to recode.</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 627.07px; height: 668.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image290.png" style="width: 627.07px; height: 668.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 6.10: jamovi transformation into three age categories, using the &lsquo;Add condition&rsquo; button</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><a id="t.3cbce5c8c5e00be5dcb7e8b9b06d39142ef585a8"></a><a id="t.17"></a><table class="c74"><tbody><tr class="c11"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c35 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">function</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">example input</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">answer</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">square root</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image102.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image103.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">5</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">absolute value</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image104.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image105.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">23</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c1 c0">logarithm (base 10)</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image106.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image107.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">3</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">logarithm (base e)</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image108.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image109.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image110.png"></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">exponentiation</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image111.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image112.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">1000.245</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c1 c0">box-cox</span></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image113.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image114.png"></p></td><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">109.551</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Table 6.4: Some of the mathematical functions available in jamovi </span></p><p class="c43 c42 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c65">6.4</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">A few more mathematical functions and operations</span></p><p class="c4"><span>In Section </span><span class="c7">6.3</span><span>&nbsp;I discussed the ideas behind variable transformations and showed that a lot of the transformations that you might want to apply to your data are based on fairly simple mathematical functions and operations. In this section I want to return to that discussion and mention several other mathematical functions and arithmetic operations that are actually quite useful for a lot of real world data analysis. Table </span><span class="c7">6.4</span><span>&nbsp;gives a brief overview of the various mathematical functions I want to talk about here, or later.</span><img src="images/image115.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Obviously this doesn&rsquo;t even come close to cataloguing the range of possibilities available, but it does cover a range of functions that are used regularly in data analysis and that are available in jamovi. </span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">6.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collapsing a number into a smaller number of discrete levels or categories</span></p><p class="c25"><span>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned earlier, jamovi has an useful range of mathematical functions built into it and there really wouldn&rsquo;t be much point in trying to describe or even list all of them. For the most part, I&rsquo;ve focused only on those functions that are strictly necessary for this book. However I do want to make an exception for logarithms and exponentials. Although they aren&rsquo;t needed anywhere else in this book, they are </span><span class="c10">everywhere</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;in statistics more broadly. And not only that, there are a lot of situations in which it is convenient to analyse the logarithm of a variable (i.e., to take a &ldquo;log-transform&rdquo; of the variable). I suspect that many (maybe most) readers of this book will have encountered logarithms and exponentials before, but from past experience I know that there&rsquo;s a substantial proportion of students who take a social science statistics class who haven&rsquo;t touched logarithms since high school, and would appreciate a bit of a refresher.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image115.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;We&rsquo;ll leave the box-cox function until later on</span></p><p class="c25"><span>In order to understand logarithms and exponentials, the easiest thing to do is to actually calculate them and see how they relate to other simple calculations. There are three jamovi functions in particular that I want to talk about, namely </span><span class="c7">LN(), LOG10() and EXP()</span><span>. To start with, let&rsquo;s consider LOG10(), which is known as the &ldquo;logarithm in base 10&rdquo;. The trick to understanding a </span><span class="c61">logarithm</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;is to understand that it&rsquo;s basically the &ldquo;opposite&rdquo; of taking a power. Specifically, the logarithm in base 10 is closely related to the powers of 10. So let&rsquo;s start by noting that 10-cubed is 1000. Mathematically, we would write this:</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><img src="images/image116.png"></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">The trick to understanding a logarithm is to recognise that the statement that &ldquo;10 to the power of 3 is equal to 1000&rdquo; is equivalent to the statement that &ldquo;the logarithm (in base 10) of 1000 is equal to 3&rdquo;. Mathematically, we write this as follows,</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><img src="images/image117.png"></p><p class="c25"><span>Okay, since the LOG10() function is related to the powers of 10, you might expect that there are other logarithms (in bases other than 10) that are related to other powers too. And of course that&rsquo;s true: there&rsquo;s not really anything mathematically special about the number 10. You and I happen to find it useful because decimal numbers are built around the number 10, but the big bad world of mathematics scoffs at our decimal numbers. Sadly, the universe doesn&rsquo;t actually care how we write down numbers. Anyway, the consequence of this cosmic indifference is that there&rsquo;s nothing particularly special about calculating logarithms in base 10. You could, for instance, calculate your logarithms in base 2. Alternatively, a third type of logarithm, and one we see a lot more of in statistics than either base 10 or base 2, is called the </span><span class="c61">natural logarithm</span><span>, and corresponds to the logarithm in base e. Since you might one day run into it, I&rsquo;d better explain what e is. The number e, known as </span><span class="c61">Euler&rsquo;s number</span><span class="c51 c52">, is one of those annoying &ldquo;irrational&rdquo; numbers whose decimal expansion is infinitely long, and is considered one of the most important numbers in mathematics. The first few digits of e are:</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><img src="images/image118.png"></p><p class="c25"><span>There are quite a few situation in statistics that require us to calculate powers of e, though none of them appear in this book. Raising e to the power x is called the </span><span class="c61">exponential</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;of x, and so it&rsquo;s very common to see e x written as exppxq. And so it&rsquo;s no surprise that jamovi has a function that calculates exponentials, called EXP(). Because the number e crops up so often in statistics, the natural logarithm (i.e., logarithm in base e) also tends to turn up. Mathematicians often write it as loge pxq or lnpxq. In fact, jamovi works the same way: the LN() function corresponds to the natural logarithm.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">And with that, I think we&rsquo;ve had quite enough exponentials and logarithms for this book! </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c65">6.5</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Ecracting a subset of the data</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">One very important kind of data handling is being able to extract a particular subset of the data. For instance, you might be interested only in analysing the data from one experimental condition, or you may want to look closely at the data from people over 50 years in age. To do this, the first step is getting jamovi to filter the subset of the data corresponding to the observations that you&rsquo;re interested in.</span></p><p class="c25"><span>This section returns to the nightgarden.csv data set. If you&rsquo;re reading this whole chapter in one sitting, then you should already have this data set loaded into a jamovi window. For this section, let&rsquo;s focus on the two variables </span><span class="c7">speaker</span><span>&nbsp;and</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;utterance</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;(see Section 6.1 if you&rsquo;ve forgotten what those variables look like). Suppose that what I want to do is pull out only those utterances that were made by Makka-Pakka. To that end, we need to specify a filter in jamovi. First open up a filter window by clicking on &lsquo;Filters&rsquo; on the main jamovi &lsquo;Data&rsquo; toolbar. Then, in the &lsquo;Filter 1&rsquo; text box, next to the &lsquo;=&rsquo; sign, type the following:</span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image119.png"></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 627.07px; height: 504.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image267.png" style="width: 627.07px; height: 504.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 6.11: Creating a subset of the nightgarden data using the jamovi &lsquo;Filters&rsquo; option</span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>When you have done this, you will see that a new column has been added to the spreadsheet window (see Figure </span><span class="c7">6.11</span><span class="c51 c52">), labelled &lsquo;Filter 1&rsquo;, with the cases where speaker is not &lsquo;makka-pakka&rsquo; greyed-out (i.e., filtered out) and, conversely, the cases where speaker is &lsquo;makka-pakka&rsquo; have a green check mark indicating they are filtered in. You can test this by running &lsquo;Exploration&rsquo; - &lsquo;Descriptives&rsquo; - &lsquo;Frequency tables&rsquo; for the speaker variable and seeing what that shows. Go on, try it!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Following on from this simple example, you can also build up more complex filters using logical expressions in jamovi. For instance, suppose I wanted to keep only those cases when the utterance is either &ldquo;pip&rdquo; or &ldquo;oo&rdquo;. In this case in the &lsquo;Filter 1&rsquo; text box, next to the &lsquo;=&rsquo; sign, you would type the following:</span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image120.png"></p><p class="c25"><span class="c65">6.6</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Summary</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">Obviously, there&rsquo;s no real coherence to this chapter.

Over the next three chapters my goal is to give you an introduction to probability theory (Chapter 7), sampling and estimation (Chapter 8) and statistical hypothesis testing (Chapter 9). Before we get started though, I want to say something about the big picture. Statistical inference is primarily about learning from data. The goal is no longer merely to describe our data but to use the data to draw conclusions about the world. To motivate the discussion I want to spend a bit of time talking about a philosophical puzzle known as the riddle of induction, because it speaks to an issue that will pop up over and over again throughout the book: statistical inference relies on assumptions. This sounds like a bad thing. In everyday life people say things like &ldquo;you should never make assumptions&rdquo;, and psychology classes often talk about assumptions and biases as bad things that we should try to avoid. From bitter personal experience I have learned never to say such things around philosophers! </span></p><h3 class="c42 c107" id="h.o2eerfrobx77"><span class="c1 c28">On the limits of logical reasoning</span></h3><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c75 c42"><span class="c51 c10">The whole art of war consists in getting at what is on the other side of the hill, or, in other words, in learning what we do not know from what we do.</span></p><p class="c75 c42"><span class="c51 c18 c81">Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington</span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c18 c81"></span></p><p class="c15"><span>I am told that quote above came about as a consequence of a carriage ride across the countryside</span><img src="images/image121.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;He and his companion, J.

Many years later when Wellesley was asked about the game he explained that &ldquo;the whole art of war consists in getting at what is on the other side of the hill&rdquo;. Indeed, war is not special in this respect. All of life is a guessing game of one form or another, and getting by on a day to day basis requires us to make good guesses. So let&rsquo;s play a guessing game of our own. </span></p><hr><p class="c6"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c15"><img src="images/image122.png"><span>&nbsp;Source: </span><span class="c52 c70 c7">http://www.bartleby.com/344/400.html</span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">Suppose you and I are observing the Wellesley-Croker competition and after every three hills you and I have to predict who will win the next one, Wellesley or Croker. Let&rsquo;s say that W refers to a Wellesley victory and C refers to a Croker victory. After three hills, our data set looks like this:</span></p><p class="c33"><img src="images/image123.png"></p><p class="c33"><span class="c51 c52">Our conversation goes like this:</span></p><p class="c33 c40"><span class="c65">YOU:</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Three in a row doesn&rsquo;t mean much.

No bet.</span></p><p class="c25 c40"><span class="c65">YOU:</span><span>&nbsp;Do you really think so? Fair enough, but my bet worked out last time and I&rsquo;m okay with my choice. </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">For a second time you were right, and for a second time I was wrong.

So yes, while I agree with you that Wellesley&rsquo;s run of 9 wins in a row is remarkable, I can&rsquo;t think of a good reason to think he&rsquo;ll win the 10th hill. No bet. </span></p><p class="c25 c40"><span class="c65">YOU:</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;I see your point, but I&rsquo;m still willing to chance it. I&rsquo;m betting on Wellesley.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">Wellesley&rsquo;s winning streak continues for the next three hills. The score in the Wellesley-Croker game is now 12-0, and the score in our game is now 3-0. As we approach the fourth round of our game, our data set is this:</span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image130.png"></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">and the conversation continues:</span></p><p class="c25 c40"><span class="c65">YOU:</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Oh yeah! Three more wins for Wellesley and another victory for me. Admit it, I was right about him! I guess we&rsquo;re both betting on Wellesley this time around, right? </span></p><p class="c25 c40"><span class="c65">ME: </span><span>I don&rsquo;t know what to think. I feel like we&rsquo;re in the same situation we were in last round, and nothing much has changed. There are only two legitimate possibilities for a sequence of 13 hills that haven&rsquo;t already been ruled out, </span><img src="images/image131.png"><span>&nbsp;and </span><img src="images/image132.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;. It&rsquo;s just like I said last time. If all possible outcomes were equally sensible before the game started, shouldn&rsquo;t these two be equally sensible now given that our observations don&rsquo;t rule out either one? I agree that it feels like Wellesley is on an amazing winning streak, but where&rsquo;s the logical evidence that the streak will continue?</span></p><p class="c25 c40"><span class="c65">YOU: </span><span class="c51 c52">I think you&rsquo;re being unreasonable. Why not take a look at our scorecard, if you need evidence? You&rsquo;re the expert on statistics and you&rsquo;ve been using this fancy logical analysis, but the fact is you&rsquo;re losing. I&rsquo;m just relying on common sense and I&rsquo;m winning. Maybe you should switch strategies. </span></p><p class="c25 c40"><span class="c65">ME:</span><span>&nbsp;Hmm, that is a good point and I don&rsquo;t want to lose the game, but I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t see any logical evidence that your strategy is better than mine. It seems to me that if there were someone else watching our game, what they&rsquo;d have observed is a run of three wins to you. Their data would look like this: </span><img src="images/image133.png"><span>&nbsp;. Logically, I don&rsquo;t see that this is any different to our first round of watching Wellesley and Croker. Three wins to you doesn&rsquo;t seem like a lot of evidence, and I see no reason to think that your strategy is working out any better than mine. If I didn&rsquo;t think that </span><img src="images/image123.png"><span>&nbsp;was good evidence then for Wellesley being better than Croker at their game, surely I have no reason now to think that </span><img src="images/image133.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;is good evidence that you&rsquo;re better at ours?</span></p><p class="c25 c40"><span class="c65">YOU:</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Okay, now I think you&rsquo;re being a jerk.</span></p><p class="c25 c40"><span class="c65">ME:</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see the logical evidence for that.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><h3 class="c107 c42" id="h.ffa1t4tf5x6b"><span class="c1 c28">Learning without making assumptions is a myth </span></h3><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">There are lots of different ways in which we could dissect this dialogue, but since this is a statistics book pitched at psychologists and not an introduction to the philosophy and psychology of reasoning, I&rsquo;ll keep it brief. What I&rsquo;ve described above is sometimes referred to as the riddle of induction. It seems entirely reasonable to think that a 12-0 winning record by Wellesley is pretty strong evidence that he will win the 13th game, but it is not easy to provide a proper logical justification for this belief. On the contrary, despite the obviousness of the answer, it&rsquo;s not actually possible to justify betting on Wellesley without relying on some assumption that you don&rsquo;t have any logical justification for.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">The riddle of induction is most associated with the philosophical work of David Hume and more recently Nelson Goodman, but you can find examples of the problem popping up in fields as diverse as literature (Lewis Carroll) and machine learning (the &ldquo;no free lunch&rdquo; theorem). There really is something weird about trying to &ldquo;learn what we do not know from what we do know&rdquo;. The critical point is that assumptions and biases are unavoidable if you want to learn anything about the world. There is no escape from this, and it is just as true for statistical inference as it is for human reasoning. In the dialogue I was taking aim at your perfectly sensible inferences as a human being, but the common sense reasoning that you relied on is no different to what a statistician would have done. Your &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; half of the dialog relied on an implicit assumption that there exists some difference in skill between Wellesley and Croker, and what you were doing was trying to work out what that difference in skill level would be. My &ldquo;logical analysis&rdquo; rejects that assumption entirely. All I was willing to accept is that there are sequences of wins and losses and that I did not know which sequences would be observed. Throughout the dialogue I kept insisting that all logically possible data sets were equally plausible at the start of the Wellesely-Croker game, and the only way in which I ever revised my beliefs was to eliminate those possibilities that were factually inconsistent with the observations.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">That sounds perfectly sensible on its own terms. In fact, it even sounds like the hallmark of good deductive reasoning. Like Sherlock Holmes, my approach was to rule out that which is impossible in the hope that what would be left is the truth. Yet as we saw, ruling out the impossible never led me to make a prediction. On its own terms everything I said in my half of the dialogue was entirely correct. An inability to make any predictions is the logical consequence of making &ldquo;no assumptions&rdquo;. In the end I lost our game because you did make some assumptions and those assumptions turned out to be right. Skill is a real thing, and because you believed in the existence of skill you were able to learn that Wellesley had more of it than Croker. Had you relied on a less sensible assumption to drive your learning you might not have won the game.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Ultimately there are two things you should take away from this. First, as I&rsquo;ve said, you cannot avoid making assumptions if you want to learn anything from your data. But second, once you realise that assumptions are necessary it becomes important to make sure you make the right ones! A data analysis that relies on few assumptions is not necessarily better than one that makes many assumptions, it all depends on whether those assumptions are good ones for your data. As we go through the rest of this book I&rsquo;ll often point out the assumptions that underpin a particular statistical technique, and how you can check whether those assumptions are sensible.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><h1 class="c111 c42" id="h.1lnkroyhkmuy"><span class="c24">7.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c58 c105 c78">Introduction to probability</span></h1><p class="c75 c42"><span class="c62 c67">[God] has afforded us only the twilight . . . of Probability.</span><span class="c51 c10">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c75 c42"><span class="c18">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c18 c63">John Locke</span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c18 c81"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">Up to this point in the book we&rsquo;ve discussed some of the key ideas in experimental design, and we&rsquo;ve talked a little about how you can summarise a data set. To a lot of people this is all there is to statistics: collecting all the numbers, calculating averages, drawing pictures, and putting them all in a report somewhere. Kind of like stamp collecting but with numbers. However, statistics covers much more than that. In fact, descriptive statistics is one of the smallest parts of statistics and one of the least powerful. The bigger and more useful part of statistics is that it provides information that lets you make inferences about data.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">Once you start thinking about statistics in these terms, that statistics is there to help us draw inferences from data, you start seeing examples of it everywhere. For instance, here&rsquo;s a tiny extract from a newspaper article in the Sydney Morning Herald (30 Oct 2010):</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">&ldquo;I have a tough job,&rdquo; the Premier said in response to a poll which found her government is now the most unpopular Labor administration in polling history, with a primary vote of just 23 per cent.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">This kind of remark is entirely unremarkable in the papers or in everyday life, but let&rsquo;s have a think about what it entails. A polling company has conducted a survey, usually a pretty big one because they can afford it. I&rsquo;m too lazy to track down the original survey so let&rsquo;s just imagine that they called 1000 New South Wales (NSW) voters at random, and 230 (23%) of those claimed that they intended to vote for the Australian Labor Party (ALP). For the 2010 Federal election the Australian Electoral Commission reported 4,610,795 enrolled voters in NSW, so the opinions of the remaining 4,609,795 voters (about 99.98% of voters) remain unknown to us. Even assuming that no-one lied to the polling company the only thing we can say with 100% confidence is that the true ALP primary vote is somewhere between 230/4610795 (about 0.005%) and 4610025/4610795 (about 99.83%). So, on what basis is it legitimate for the polling company, the newspaper, and the readership to conclude that the ALP primary vote is only about 23%?</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c51 c52">The answer to the question is pretty obvious. If I call 1000 people at random, and 230 of them say they intend to vote for the ALP, then it seems very unlikely that these are the only 230 people out of the entire voting public who actually intend to vote ALP. In other words, we assume that the data collected by the polling company is pretty representative of the population at large. But how representative? Would we be surprised to discover that the true ALP primary vote is actually 24%? 29%? 37%? At this point everyday intuition starts to break down a bit. No-one would be surprised by 24%, and everybody would be surprised by 37%, but it&rsquo;s a bit hard to say whether 29% is plausible. We need some more powerful tools than just looking at the numbers and guessing. </span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c61">Inferential statistics</span><span>&nbsp;provides the tools that we need to answer these sorts of questions, and since these kinds of questions lie at the heart of the scientific enterprise, they take up the lions share of every introductory course on statistics and research methods. However, the theory of statistical inference is built on top of probability theory. And it is to probability theory that we must now turn. This discussion of </span><span class="c61">probability theory</span><span>&nbsp;is basically background detail. There&rsquo;s not a lot of statistics per se in this chapter, and you don&rsquo;t need to understand this material in as much depth as the other chapters in this part of the book. Nevertheless, because probability theory does underpin so much of statistics, it&rsquo;s worth covering some of the basics.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c65">7.1</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">How are probability and statistics different?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Before we start talking about probability theory, it&rsquo;s helpful to spend a moment thinking about the relationship between probability and statistics. The two disciplines are closely related but they&rsquo;re not identical. Probability theory is &ldquo;the doctrine of chances&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a branch of mathematics that tells you how often different kinds of events will happen. For example, all of these questions are things you can answer using probability theory:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_of50we9rnnwc-0 start"><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">What are the chances of a fair coin coming up heads 10 times in a row?</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">If I roll a six sided dice twice, how likely is it that I&rsquo;ll roll two sixes? </span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">How likely is it that five cards drawn from a perfectly shuffled deck will all be hearts?</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">What are the chances that I&rsquo;ll win the lottery? </span></li></ul><p class="c4"><span>Notice that all of these questions have something in common. In each case the &ldquo;truth of the world&rdquo; is known and my question relates to the &ldquo;what kind of events&rdquo; will happen. In the first question I know that the coin is fair so there&rsquo;s a 50% chance that any individual coin flip will come up heads. In the second question I know that the chance of rolling a 6 on a single die is 1 in 6. In the third question I know that the deck is shuffled properly. And in the fourth question I know that the lottery follows specific rules. You get the idea. The critical point is that probabilistic questions start with a known </span><span class="c102">model</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;of the world, and we use that model to do some calculations. The underlying model can be quite simple. For instance, in the coin flipping example we can write down the model like this:</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><img src="images/image134.png"></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">which you can read as &ldquo;the probability of heads is 0.5&rdquo;. As we&rsquo;ll see later, in the same way that percentages are numbers that range from 0% to 100%, probabilities are just numbers that range</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">from 0 to 1. When using this probability model to answer the first question I don&rsquo;t actually know exactly what&rsquo;s going to happen. Maybe I&rsquo;ll get 10 heads, like the question says. But maybe I&rsquo;ll get three heads. That&rsquo;s the key thing. In probability theory the model is known but the data are not.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">So that&rsquo;s probability. What about statistics? Statistical questions work the other way around. In statistics we do not know the truth about the world. All we have is the data and it is from the data that we want to learn the truth about the world. Statistical questions tend to look more like these:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_mfyr1rzas3cb-0 start"><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">If my friend flips a coin 10 times and gets 10 heads are they playing a trick on me?</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">If five cards off the top of the deck are all hearts how likely is it that the deck was shuffled?</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">If the lottery commissioner&rsquo;s spouse wins the lottery how likely is it that the lottery was rigged?</span></li></ul><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">This time around the only thing we have are data. What I know is that I saw my friend flip the coin 10 times and it came up heads every time. And what I want to infer is whether or not I should conclude that what I just saw was actually a fair coin being flipped 10 times in a row, or whether I should suspect that my friend is playing a trick on me. The data I have look like this:</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">H H H H H H H H H H H</span></p><p class="c4"><span>and what I&rsquo;m trying to do is work out which &ldquo;model of the world&rdquo; I should put my trust in. If the coin is fair then the model I should adopt is one that says that the probability of heads is 0.5, that is Ppheadsq &ldquo; 0.5. If the coin is not fair then I should conclude that the probability of heads is not 0.5, which we would write as </span><img src="images/image134.png"><span class="c51 c52">. In other words, the statistical inference problem is to figure out which of these probability models is right. Clearly, the statistical question isn&rsquo;t the same as the probability question, but they&rsquo;re deeply connected to one another. Because of this, a good introduction to statistical theory will start with a discussion of what probability is and how it works.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c65">7.2</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">what does probability mean ?</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c58"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Let&rsquo;s start with the first of these questions. What is &ldquo;probability&rdquo;? It might seem surprising to you but while statisticians and mathematicians (mostly) agree on what the rules of probability are, there&rsquo;s much less of a consensus on what the word really means. It seems weird because we&rsquo;re all very comfortable using words like &ldquo;chance&rdquo;, &ldquo;likely&rdquo;, &ldquo;possible&rdquo; and &ldquo;probable&rdquo;, and it doesn&rsquo;t seem like it should be a very difficult question to answer. But if you&rsquo;ve ever had that experience in real life you might walk away from the conversation feeling like you didn&rsquo;t quite get it right, and that (like many everyday concepts) it turns out that you don&rsquo;t really know what it&rsquo;s all about. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">So I&rsquo;ll have a go at it. Let&rsquo;s suppose I want to bet on a soccer game between two teams of robots, Arduino Arsenal and C Milan. After thinking about it, I decide that there is an 80% probability of Arduino Arsenal winning. What do I mean by that? Here are three possibilities:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_t1mc80mgewtg-0 start"><li class="c4 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">They&rsquo;re robot teams so I can make them play over and over again, and if I did that Arduino Arsenal would win 8 out of every 10 games on average.</span></li><li class="c4 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">For any given game, I would agree that betting on this game is only &ldquo;fair&rdquo; if a $1 bet on C Milan gives a $5 payoff (i.e. I get my $1 back plus a $4 reward for being correct), as would a $4 bet on Arduino Arsenal (i.e., my $4 bet plus a $1 reward).</span></li><li class="c4 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">My subjective &ldquo;belief&rdquo; or &ldquo;confidence&rdquo; in an Arduino Arsenal victory is four times as strong as my belief in a C Milan victory.</span></li></ul><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0">Each of these seems sensible. However, they&rsquo;re not identical and not every statistician would endorse all of them. The reason is that there are different statistical ideologies (yes, really!) and depending on which one you subscribe to, you might say that some of those statements are meaningless or irrelevant. In this section I give a brief introduction the two main approaches that exist in the literature. These are by no means the only approaches, but they&rsquo;re the two big ones.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">7.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequentist view</span></p><p class="c4"><span>The first of the two major approaches to probability, and the more dominant one in statistics, is referred to as the </span><span class="c61">frequentist view</span><span>&nbsp;and it defines probability as a </span><span class="c61">long-run frequency</span><span>. Suppose we were to try flipping a fair coin over and over again. By definition this is a coin that has </span><img src="images/image135.png"><span class="c51 c52">. What might we observe? One possibility is that the first 20 flips might look like this:</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">T,H,H,H,H,T,T,H,H,H,H,T,H,H,T,T,T,T,T,H</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">In this case 11 of these 20 coin flips (55%) came up heads. Now suppose that I&rsquo;d been keeping a running tally of the number of heads (which I&rsquo;ll call NH) that I&rsquo;ve seen, across the first N flips, and calculate the proportion of heads NH{N every time. Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d get (I did literally flip coins to produce this!):</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><a id="t.639ce1c645c57b7c64962ef57d7f3b57c39e8223"></a><a

sequence the proportion of heads fluctuates wildly, starting at .00 and rising as high as .80. Later on, one gets the impression that it dampens out a bit, with more and more of the values actually being pretty close to the &ldquo;right&rdquo; answer of .50. This is the frequentist definition of probability in a nutshell. Flip a fair coin over and over again, and as N grows large (approaches infinity, denoted N &Ntilde; 8) the proportion of heads will converge to 50%. There are some subtle technicalities that the mathematicians care about, but qualitatively speaking that&rsquo;s how the frequentists define probability. Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have an infinite number of coins or the infinite patience required to flip a coin an infinite number of times. However, I do have a computer and computers excel at mindless repetitive tasks. So I asked my computer to simulate flipping a coin 1000 times and then drew a picture of what happens to the proportion NH{N as N increases. Actually, I did it four times just to make sure it wasn&rsquo;t a fluke. The results are shown in Figure 7.1. As you can see, the proportion of observed heads eventually stops fluctuating and settles down. When it does, the number at which it finally settles is the true probability of heads. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>The frequentist definition of probability has some desirable characteristics. First, it is objective. The probability of an event is necessarily grounded in the world. The only way that probability statements can make sense is if they refer to (a sequence of) events that occur in the physical universe</span><img src="images/image136.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;</span></p><hr><p class="c4 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4"><img src="images/image2.png"><span class="c1 c34">&nbsp;This doesn&rsquo;t mean that frequentists can&rsquo;t make hypothetical statements, of course. It&rsquo;s just that if you want to make a statement about probability then it must be possible to redescribe that statement in terms of a sequence of potentially observable events, together with the relative frequencies of different outcomes that appear within that sequence.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Secondly, it is unambiguous. Any two people watching the same sequence of events unfold, trying to calculate the probability of an event, must inevitably come up with the same answer.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">However, it also has undesirable characteristics. First, infinite sequences don&rsquo;t exist in the physical world. Suppose you picked up a coin from your pocket and started to flip it. Every time it lands it impacts on the ground. Each impact wears the coin down a bit. Eventually the coin will be destroyed. So, one might ask whether it really makes sense to pretend that an &ldquo;infinite&rdquo; sequence of coin flips is even a meaningful concept, or an objective one. We can&rsquo;t say that an &ldquo;infinite sequence&rdquo; of events is a real thing in the physical universe, because the physical universe doesn&rsquo;t allow infinite anything. More seriously, the frequentist definition has a narrow scope. There are lots of things out there that human beings are happy to assign probability to in everyday language, but cannot (even in theory) be mapped onto a hypothetical sequence of events. For instance, if a meteorologist comes on TV and says &ldquo;the probability of rain in Adelaide on 2 November 2048 is 60%&rdquo; we humans are happy to accept this. But it&rsquo;s not clear how to define this in frequentist terms. There&rsquo;s only one city of Adelaide, and only one 2 November 2048. There&rsquo;s no infinite sequence of events here, just a one-off thing. Frequentist probability genuinely forbids us from making probability statements about a single event. From the frequentist perspective it will either rain tomorrow or it will not. There is no &ldquo;probability&rdquo; that attaches to a single non-repeatable event. Now, it should be said that there are some very clever tricks that frequentists can use to get around this. One possibility is that what the meteorologist means is something like &ldquo;There is a category of days for which I predict a 60% chance of rain, and if we look only across those days for which I make this prediction, then on 60% of those days it will actually rain&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s very weird and counterintuitive to think of it this way, but you do see frequentists do this sometimes. And it will come up later in this book (see Section 8.5). </span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 627.07px; height: 612.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image269.png" style="width: 627.07px; height: 612.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 7.1: An illustration of how frequentist probability works. If you flip a fair coin over and over again the proportion of heads that you&rsquo;ve seen eventually settles down and converges to the true probability of 0.5. Each panel shows four different simulated experiments. In each case we pretend we flipped a coin 1000 times and kept track of the proportion of flips that were heads as we went along. Although none of these sequences actually ended up with an exact value of .5, if we&rsquo;d extended the experiment for an infinite number of coin flips they would have.</span></p><p class="c43 c42 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c43 c42 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c43 c42 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c43 c42 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">7.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bayesian view</span></p><p class="c4"><span>The </span><span class="c61">Bayesian view</span><span>&nbsp;of probability is often called the subjectivist view, and although it has been a minority view among statisticians it has been steadily gaining traction for the last several decades. There are many flavours of Bayesianism, making it hard to say exactly what &ldquo;the&rdquo; Bayesian view is. The most common way of thinking about subjective probability is to define the probability of an event as the </span><span class="c61">degree of belief</span><span class="c65">&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c52">that an intelligent and rational agent assigns to that truth of that event. From that perspective, probabilities don&rsquo;t exist in the world but rather in the thoughts and assumptions of people and other intelligent beings.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">However, in order for this approach to work we need some way of operationalising &ldquo;degree of belief&rdquo;. One way that you can do this is to formalise it in terms of &ldquo;rational gambling&rdquo;, though there are many other ways. Suppose that I believe that there&rsquo;s a 60% probability of rain tomorrow. If someone offers me a bet that if it rains tomorrow then I win $5, but if it doesn&rsquo;t rain I lose $5. Clearly, from my perspective, this is a pretty good bet. On the other hand, if I think that the probability of rain is only 40% then it&rsquo;s a bad bet to take. So we can operationalise the notion of a &ldquo;subjective probability&rdquo; in terms of what bets I&rsquo;m willing to accept.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">What are the advantages and disadvantages to the Bayesian approach? The main advantage is that it allows you to assign probabilities to any event you want to. You don&rsquo;t need to be limited to those events that are repeatable. The main disadvantage (to many people) is that we can&rsquo;t be purely objective. Specifying a probability requires us to specify an entity that has the relevant degree of belief. This entity might be a human, an alien, a robot, or even a statistician. But there has to be an intelligent agent out there that believes in things. To many people this is uncomfortable, it seems to make probability arbitrary. Whilst the Bayesian approach requires that the agent in question be rational (i.e., obey the rules of probability), it does allow everyone to have their own beliefs. I can believe the coin is fair and you don&rsquo;t have to, even though we&rsquo;re both rational. The frequentist view doesn&rsquo;t allow any two observers to attribute different probabilities to the same event. When that happens then at least one of them must be wrong. The Bayesian view does not prevent this from occurring. Two observers with different background knowledge can legitimately hold different beliefs about the same event. In short, where the frequentist view is sometimes considered to be too narrow (forbids lots of things that that we want to assign probabilities to), the Bayesian view is sometimes thought to be too broad (allows too many differences between observers).<br></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">7.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&rsquo;s the difference? And who is right?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0">Now that you&rsquo;ve seen each of these two views independently it&rsquo;s useful to make sure you can compare the two. Go back to the hypothetical robot soccer game at the start of the section. What do you think a frequentist and a Bayesian would say about these three statements? Which statement would a frequentist say is the correct definition of probability? Which one would a Bayesian opt for? Would some of these statements be meaningless to a frequentist or a Bayesian? If you&rsquo;ve understood the two perspectives you should have some sense of how to answer those questions.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Okay, assuming you understand the difference then you might be wondering which of them is right? Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know that there is a right answer. As far as I can tell there&rsquo;s nothing mathematically incorrect about the way frequentists think about sequences of events, and there&rsquo;s nothing mathematically incorrect about the way that Bayesians define the beliefs of a rational agent. In fact, when you dig down into the details Bayesians and frequentists actually agree about a lot of things. Many frequentist methods lead to decisions that Bayesians agree a rational agent would make. Many Bayesian methods have very good frequentist properties.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>For the most part, I&rsquo;m a pragmatist so I&rsquo;ll use any statistical method that I trust. As it turns out, that makes me prefer Bayesian methods for reasons I&rsquo;ll explain towards the end of the book. But I&rsquo;m not fundamentally opposed to frequentist methods. Not everyone is quite so relaxed. For instance, consider Sir Ronald Fisher, one of the towering figures of 20th century statistics and a vehement opponent to all things Bayesian, whose paper on the mathematical foundations of statistics referred to Bayesian probability as &ldquo;an impenetrable jungle [that] arrests progress towards precision of statistical concepts&rdquo; (</span><span class="c7">Fisher 1922, p. 134</span><span>). Or the psychologist Paul Meehl, who suggests that relying on frequentist methods could turn you into &ldquo;a potent but sterile intellectual rake who leaves in his merry path a long train of ravished maidens but no viable scientific offspring&rdquo; (</span><span class="c7">Meehl 1967</span><span class="c51 c52">). The history of statistics, as you might gather, is not devoid of entertainment.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>In any case, whilst I personally prefer the Bayesian view, the majority of statistical analyses are based on the frequentist approach. My reasoning is pragmatic. The goal of this book is to cover roughly the same territory as a typical undergraduate stats class in psychology, and if you want to understand the statistical tools used by most psychologists you&rsquo;ll need a good grasp of frequentist methods. I promise you that this isn&rsquo;t wasted effort. Even if you end up wanting to switch to the Bayesian perspective, you really should read through at least one book on the &ldquo;orthodox&rdquo; frequentist view. Besides, I won&rsquo;t completely ignore the Bayesian perspective. Every now and then I&rsquo;ll add some commentary from a Bayesian point of view, and I&rsquo;ll revisit the topic in more depth in Chapter </span><span class="c7">16</span><span class="c51 c52">.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c65">7.3</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Basic probability theory</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Ideological arguments between Bayesians and frequentists notwithstanding, it turns out that people mostly agree on the rules that probabilities should obey. There are lots of different ways of arriving at these rules. The most commonly used approach is based on the work of Andrey Kolmogorov, one of the great Soviet mathematicians of the 20th century. I won&rsquo;t go into a lot of detail, but I&rsquo;ll try to give you a bit of a sense of how it works. And in order to do so I&rsquo;m going to have to talk about my trousers. </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">7.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introducing probability distribution</span></p><p class="c4"><span>One of the disturbing truths about my life is that I only own 5 pairs of trousers. Three pairs of jeans, the bottom half of a suit, and a pair of tracksuit pants. Even sadder, I&rsquo;ve given them names: I call them </span><img src="images/image9.png"><span>, </span><img src="images/image10.png"><span>, </span><img src="images/image25.png"><span>, </span><img src="images/image26.png"><span>&nbsp;and </span><img src="images/image27.png"><span>. I really have, that&rsquo;s why they call me Mister Imaginative. Now, on any given day, I pick out exactly one of pair of trousers to wear. Not even I&rsquo;m so stupid as to try to wear two pairs of trousers, and thanks to years of training I never go outside without wearing trousers anymore. If I were to describe this situation using the language of probability theory, I would refer to each pair of trousers (i.e., each </span><img src="images/image11.png"><span>) as an elementary event. The key characteristic of </span><span class="c61">elementary events</span><span>&nbsp;is that every time we make an observation (e.g., every time I put on a pair of trousers) then the outcome will be one and only one of these events. Like I said, these days I always wear exactly one pair of trousers so my trousers satisfy this constraint. Similarly, the set of all possible events is called a </span><span class="c61">sample space</span><span class="c51 c52">. Granted, some people would call it a &ldquo;wardrobe&rdquo;, but that&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re refusing to think about my trousers in probabilistic terms. Sad.</span></p><p class="c25"><span>Okay, now that we have a sample space (a wardrobe), which is built from lots of possible elementary events (trousers), what we want to do is assign a </span><span class="c61">probability</span><span>&nbsp;of one of these elementary events. For an event </span><img src="images/image11.png"><span>, the probability of that event </span><img src="images/image137.png"><span>is a number that lies between 0 and 1. The bigger the value of </span><img src="images/image137.png"><span>, the more likely the event is to occur. So, for example, if </span><img src="images/image138.png"><span>&nbsp;it means the event </span><img src="images/image11.png"><span>&nbsp;is impossible (i.e., I never wear those trousers). On the other hand, if &nbsp;</span><img src="images/image139.png"><span>&nbsp;it means that event </span><img src="images/image11.png"><span>&nbsp;is certain to occur (i.e., I always wear those trousers). For probability values in the middle it means that I sometimes wear those trousers. For instance, if </span><img src="images/image140.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;it means that I wear those trousers half of the time.</span></p><p class="c25"><span>At this point, we&rsquo;re almost done. The last thing we need to recognise is that &ldquo;something always happens&rdquo;. Every time I put on trousers, I really do end up wearing trousers (crazy, right?). What this somewhat trite statement means, in probabilistic terms, is that the probabilities of the elementary events need to add up to 1. This is known as the</span><span class="c61">&nbsp;law of total probability</span><span>, not that any of us really care. More importantly, if these requirements are satisfied then what we have is a </span><span class="c61">probability distribution</span><span class="c51 c52">. For example, this is an example of a probability distribution:</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><a id="t.dc8b7c7a9b77cebd87d48fb4f8645592d91a64d7"></a><a id="t.20"></a><table class="c74"><tbody><tr class="c11"><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">Which trousers?</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Label</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">Probability</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">Blue jeans</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">X1</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image141.png"></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">Grey jeans</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">X2</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image142.png"></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">Black jeans</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">X3</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image143.png"></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">Black suit</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">X4</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image144.png"></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">Blue tracksuit </span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">X5</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image145.png"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span>Each of the events has a probability that lies between 0 and 1, and if we add up the probability of all events they sum to 1.

The easiest way to illustrate the concept is with an example. In the trousers example it&rsquo;s perfectly legitimate to refer to the probability that I wear jeans. In this scenario, the &ldquo;Dan wears jeans&rdquo; event is said to have happened as long as the elementary event that actually did occur is one of the appropriate ones. In this case &ldquo;blue jeans&rdquo;, &ldquo;black jeans&rdquo; or &ldquo;grey jeans&rdquo;. In mathematical terms we defined the &ldquo;jeans&rdquo; event E to correspond to the set of elementary events </span><img src="images/image146.png"><span>. If any of these elementary events occurs then E is also said to have occurred. Having decided to write down the definition of the E this way, it&rsquo;s pretty straightforward to state what the probability </span><img src="images/image147.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;is: we just add everything up. In this particular case</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><img src="images/image148.png"></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">and, since the probabilities of blue, grey and black jeans respectively are .5, .3 and .1, the probability that I wear jeans is equal to .9.</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 519.03px; height: 386.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image274.png" style="width: 519.03px; height: 386.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 7.2: A visual depiction of the &ldquo;trousers&rdquo; probability distribution.

However, they aren&rsquo;t all equally important. In fact, the vast majority of the content in this book relies on one of five distributions: the binomial distribution, the normal distribution, the t distribution, the &chi; 2 (&ldquo;chi-square&rdquo;) distribution and the F distribution. Given this, what I&rsquo;ll do over the next few sections is provide a brief introduction to all five of these, paying special attention to the binomial and the normal. I&rsquo;ll start with the binomial distribution since it&rsquo;s the simplest of the five.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">7.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introdicing the binomial</span></p><p class="c25"><span>The theory of probability originated in the attempt to describe how games of chance work, so it seems fitting that our discussion of the </span><span class="c61">binomial distribution</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;should involve a discussion of rolling dice and flipping coins. Let&rsquo;s imagine a simple &ldquo;experiment&rdquo;. In my hot little hand I&rsquo;m holding 20 identical six-sided dice. On one face of each die there&rsquo;s a picture of a skull, the other five faces are all blank. If I proceed to roll all 20 dice, what&rsquo;s the probability that I&rsquo;ll get exactly 4 skulls? Assuming that the dice are fair, we know that the chance of any one die coming up skulls is 1 in 6. To say this another way, the skull probability for a single die is approximately .167. This is enough information to answer our question, so let&rsquo;s have a look at how it&rsquo;s done.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 663.00px; height: 231.03px;"><img alt="" src="images/image272.png" style="width: 663.00px; height: 231.03px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><a id="t.7ca5b21045766adf495e30dd9f3ac80965b3d42c"></a><a id="t.22"></a><table class="c74"><tbody><tr class="c11"><td class="c130" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c35"><span class="c51 c52">Binomial</span></p></td><td class="c130" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c35"><span class="c51 c52">Normal</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c130" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c35"><img src="images/image158.png"></p></td><td class="c130" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c35"><img src="images/image159.png"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">Table 7.2: Formulas for the binomial and normal distributions. We don&rsquo;t really use these formulas for anything in this book, but they&rsquo;re pretty important for more advanced work, so I thought it might be best to put them here in a table, where they can&rsquo;t get in the way of the text. In the equation for the binomial, X! is the factorial function (i.e., multiply all whole numbers from 1 to X), and for the normal distribution &ldquo;exp&rdquo; refers to the exponential function, which we discussed in Chapter 6. If these equations don&rsquo;t make a lot of sense to you, don&rsquo;t worry too much about them. </span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span>As usual, we&rsquo;ll want to introduce some names and some notation. We&rsquo;ll let N denote the number of dice rolls in our experiment, which is often referred to as the </span><span class="c61">size parameter</span><span>&nbsp;of our binomial distribution. We&rsquo;ll also use &theta; to refer to the the probability that a single die comes up skulls, a quantity that is usually called the </span><span class="c61">success probability</span><span>&nbsp;of the binomial</span><img src="images/image160.png"><span>&nbsp;Finally, we&rsquo;ll use X to refer to the results of our experiment, namely the number of skulls I get when I roll the dice. Since the actual value of X is due to chance we refer to it as a random variable. In any case, now that we have all this terminology and notation we can use it to state the problem a little more precisely. The quantity that we want to calculate is the probability that </span><img src="images/image161.png"><span>&nbsp;given that we know that </span><img src="images/image162.png"><span>&nbsp;and </span><img src="images/image163.png"><span class="c51 c52">. The general &ldquo;form&rdquo; of the thing I&rsquo;m interested in calculating could be written as </span></p><p class="c43 c42"><img src="images/image164.png"></p><p class="c25"><span>and we&rsquo;re interested in the special case where </span><img src="images/image165.png"><span>, </span><img src="images/image166.png"><span>&nbsp;and </span><img src="images/image163.png"><span>. There&rsquo;s only one more piece of notation I want to refer to before moving on to discuss the solution to the problem. If I want to say that </span><img src="images/image11.png"><span>&nbsp;is generated randomly from a binomial distribution with parameters </span><img src="images/image167.png"><span>&nbsp;and </span><img src="images/image56.png"><span class="c51 c52">, the notation I would use is as follows:</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><img src="images/image168.png"></p><p class="c25"><span>Yeah, yeah. I know what you&rsquo;re thinking: notation, notation, notation. Really, who cares? Very few readers of this book are here for the notation, so I should probably move on and talk about how to use the binomial distribution. I&rsquo;ve included the formula for the binomial distribution in Table </span><span class="c7">7.2</span><span class="c51 c52">, since some readers may want to play with it themselves, but since most people probably don&rsquo;t care that much and because we don&rsquo;t need the formula in this book, I won&rsquo;t talk about it in any detail. Instead, I just want to show you what the binomial distribution looks like.</span></p><p class="c25"><span>To that end, Figure </span><span class="c7">7.3</span><span>&nbsp;plots the binomial probabilities for all possible values of X for our dice rolling experiment, from </span><img src="images/image169.png"><span>&nbsp;(no skulls) all the way up to </span><img src="images/image170.png"><span>&nbsp;(all skulls). Note that this is basically a bar chart, and is no different to the &ldquo;trousers probability&rdquo; plot I drew in Figure </span><span class="c7">7.2</span><span class="c51 c52">. On the horizontal axis we have all the possible events, and on the vertical axis we can read off the probability of each of those events. So, the probability of rolling 4 skulls out of 20 is about 0.20 (the actual answer is 0.2022036, as we&rsquo;ll see in a moment). In other words, you&rsquo;d expect that to happen about 20% of the times you repeated this experiment.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image3.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Note that the term &ldquo;success&rdquo; is pretty arbitrary and doesn&rsquo;t actually imply that the outcome is something to be desired. If &theta; referred to the probability that any one passenger gets injured in a bus crash I&rsquo;d still call it the success probability, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I want people to get hurt in bus crashes!</span></p><p class="c25"><span>To give you a feel for how the binomial distribution changes when we alter the values of </span><img src="images/image167.png"><span>&nbsp;and </span><img src="images/image56.png"><span>, let&rsquo;s suppose that instead of rolling dice I&rsquo;m actually flipping coins. This time around, my experiment involves flipping a fair coin repeatedly and the outcome that I&rsquo;m interested in is the number of heads that I observe. In this scenario, the success probability is now </span><img src="images/image171.png"><span>. Suppose I were to flip the coin </span><img src="images/image163.png"><span>times. In this example, I&rsquo;ve changed the success probability but kept the size of the experiment the same. What does this do to our binomial distribution? Well, as Figure </span><span class="c7">7.4a</span><span>&nbsp;shows, the main effect of this is to shift the whole distribution, as you&rsquo;d expect. Okay, what if we flipped a coin </span><img src="images/image172.png"><span>&nbsp;times? Well, in that case we get Figure </span><span class="c7">7.4b</span><span class="c1 c0">. The distribution stays roughly in the middle but there&rsquo;s a bit more variability in the possible outcomes. </span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 579.03px; height: 386.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image256.png" style="width: 579.03px; height: 386.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Figure 7.3: The binomial distribution with size parameter of </span><img src="images/image173.png"><span>&nbsp;and an underlying success probability of </span><img src="images/image174.png"><span>.

The x-axis corresponds to the value of some variable, and the y-axis tells us something about how likely we are to observe that value. However, notice that the y-axis is labelled &ldquo;Probability Density&rdquo; and not &ldquo;Probability&rdquo;. There is a subtle and somewhat frustrating characteristic of continuous distributions that makes the y axis behave a bit oddly: the height of the curve here isn&rsquo;t actually the probability of observing a particular </span><img src="images/image175.png"><span>&nbsp;value. On the other hand, it is true that the heights of the curve tells you which </span><img src="images/image175.png"><span>&nbsp;values are more likely (the higher ones!). (see Section </span><span class="c7">7.5.1</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;for all the annoying details) </span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span>The notation that we sometimes use to say that a variable </span><img src="images/image11.png"><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;is normally distributed is as follows: </span></p><p class="c43 c42"><img src="images/image176.png"></p><p class="c4"><span>Of course, that&rsquo;s just notation. It doesn&rsquo;t tell us anything interesting about the normal distribution itself. As was the case with the binomial distribution, I have included the formula for the normal distribution in this book, because I think it&rsquo;s important enough that everyone who learns statistics should at least look at it, but since this is an introductory text I don&rsquo;t want to focus on it, so I&rsquo;ve tucked it away in Table </span><span class="c7">7.2</span><span class="c51 c52">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Instead of focusing on the maths, let&rsquo;s try to get a sense for what it means for a variable to be normally distributed. To that end, have a look at Figure </span><span class="c7">7.5</span><span>&nbsp;which plots a normal distribution with mean </span><img src="images/image177.png"><span>&nbsp;and standard deviation </span><img src="images/image178.png"><span>. You can see where the name &ldquo;bell curve&rdquo; comes from; it looks a bit like a bell. Notice that, unlike the plots that I drew to illustrate the binomial distribution, the picture of the normal distribution in Figure </span><span class="c7">7.5</span><span>&nbsp;shows a smooth curve instead of &ldquo;histogram-like&rdquo; bars. This isn&rsquo;t an arbitrary choice, the normal distribution is continuous whereas the binomial is discrete. For instance, in the die rolling example from the last section it was possible to get 3 skulls or 4 skulls, but impossible to get 3.9 skulls. The figures that I drew in the previous section reflected this fact. In Figure </span><span class="c7">7.3</span><span>, for instance, there&rsquo;s a bar located at </span><img src="images/image179.png"><span>&nbsp;and another one at </span><img src="images/image161.png"><span>&nbsp;but there&rsquo;s nothing in between. Continuous quantities don&rsquo;t have this constraint. For instance, suppose we&rsquo;re talking about the weather. The temperature on a pleasant Spring day could be 23 degrees, 24 degrees, 23.9 degrees, or anything in between since temperature is a continuous variable. And so a normal distribution might be quite appropriate for describing Spring temperatures</span><img src="images/image180.png"></p><p class="c25"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 627.07px; height: 412.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image245.png" style="width: 627.07px; height: 412.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 7.6: An illustration of what happens when you change the mean of a normal distribution. The solid line depicts a normal distribution with a mean of &micro; = 4. The dashed line shows a normal distribution with a mean of &micro;= 7. In both cases, the standard deviation is &sigma; = 1. Not surprisingly, the two distributions have the same shape, but the dashed line is shifted to the right. </span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">With this in mind, let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t get an intuition for how the normal distribution works. First, let&rsquo;s have a look at what happens when we play around with the parameters of the distribution. To that end, Figure 7.6 plots normal distributions that have different means</span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4"><img src="images/image4.png"><span class="c51 c52">In practice, the normal distribution is so handy that people tend to use it even when the variable isn&rsquo;t actually continuous. As long as there are enough categories (e.g., Likert scale responses to a questionnaire), it&rsquo;s pretty standard practice to use the normal distribution as an approximation. This works out much better in practice than you&rsquo;d think.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 627.07px; height: 422.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image246.png" style="width: 627.07px; height: 422.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 7.7: An illustration of what happens when you change the the standard deviation of a normal distribution. Both distributions plotted in this figure have a mean of &micro; = 5, but they have different standard deviations. The solid line plots a distribution with standard deviation &sigma; = 1, and the dashed line shows a distribution with standard deviation &sigma; = 2. As a consequence, both distributions are &ldquo;centred&rdquo; on the same spot, but the dashed line is wider than the solid one. </span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>but have the same standard deviation. As you might expect, all of these distributions have the same &ldquo;width&rdquo;. The only difference between them is that they&rsquo;ve been shifted to the left or to the right. In every other respect they&rsquo;re identical. In contrast, if we increase the standard deviation while keeping the mean constant, the peak of the distribution stays in the same place but the distribution gets wider, as you can see in Figure </span><span class="c7">7.7</span><span>. Notice, though, that when we widen the distribution the height of the peak shrinks. This has to happen, in the same way that the heights of the bars that we used to draw a discrete binomial distribution have to sum to 1, the total area under the curve for the normal distribution must equal 1. Before moving on, I want to point out one important characteristic of the normal distribution. Irrespective of what the actual mean and standard deviation are, 68.3% of the area falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean. Similarly, 95.4% of the distribution falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean, and 99.7% of the distribution is within 3 standard deviations.

In panel b, we see that there is a 95.4% chance that an observation will fall within two standard deviations of the mean.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 627.07px; height: 248.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image271.png" style="width: 627.07px; height: 248.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 7.9: Two more examples of the &ldquo;area under the curve idea&rdquo;.

Notice that if you add these two numbers together you get 15.9% + 34.1% = 50%. For normally distributed data, there is a 50% chance that an observation falls below the mean.

They might be right to do so. This &ldquo;thing&rdquo; that I&rsquo;m hiding is weird and counter-intuitive even by the admittedly distorted standards that apply in statistics. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s not something that you need to understand at a deep level in order to do basic statistics. Rather, it&rsquo;s something that starts to become important later on when you move beyond the basics. So, if it doesn&rsquo;t make complete sense, don&rsquo;t worry too much, but try to make sure that you follow the gist of it. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>Throughout my discussion of the normal distribution there&rsquo;s been one or two things that don&rsquo;t quite make sense. Perhaps you noticed that the y-axis in these figures is labelled &ldquo;Probability Density&rdquo; rather than density. Maybe you noticed that I used </span><img src="images/image181.png"><span>instead of </span><img src="images/image137.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;when giving the formula for the normal distribution. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>As it turns out, what is presented here isn&rsquo;t actually a probability, it&rsquo;s something else. To understand what that something is you have to spend a little time thinking about what it really means to say that </span><img src="images/image11.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;is a continuous variable. Let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re talking about the temperature outside. The thermometer tells me it&rsquo;s 23 degrees, but I know that&rsquo;s not really true. It&rsquo;s not exactly 23 degrees. Maybe it&rsquo;s 23.1 degrees, I think to myself. But I know that that&rsquo;s not really true either because it might actually be 23.09 degrees. But I know that... well, you get the idea. The tricky thing with genuinely continuous quantities is that you never really know exactly what they are. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Now think about what this implies when we talk about probabilities. Suppose that tomorrow&rsquo;s maximum temperature is sampled from a normal distribution with mean 23 and standard deviation 1. What&rsquo;s the probability that the temperature will be exactly 23 degrees? The answer is &ldquo;zero&rdquo;, or possibly &ldquo;a number so close to zero that it might as well be zero&rdquo;. Why is this? It&rsquo;s like trying to throw a dart at an infinitely small dart board. No matter how good your aim, you&rsquo;ll never hit it. In real life you&rsquo;ll never get a value of exactly 23. It&rsquo;ll always be something like 23.1 or 22.99998 or suchlike. In other words, it&rsquo;s completely meaningless to talk about the probability that the temperature is exactly 23 degrees. However, in everyday language if I told you that it was 23 degrees outside and it turned out to be 22.9998 degrees you probably wouldn&rsquo;t call me a liar. Because in everyday language &ldquo;23 degrees&rdquo; usually means something like &ldquo;somewhere between 22.5 and 23.5 degrees&rdquo;. And while it doesn&rsquo;t feel very meaningful to ask about the probability that the temperature is exactly 23 degrees, it does seem sensible to ask about the probability that the temperature lies between 22.5 and 23.5, or between 20 and 30, or any other range of temperatures. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>The point of this discussion is to make clear that when we&rsquo;re talking about continuous distributions it&rsquo;s not meaningful to talk about the probability of a specific value. However, what we can talk about is the probability that the value lies within a particular range of values. To find out the probability associated with a particular range what you need to do is calculate the &ldquo;area under the curve&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ve seen this concept already, in Figure </span><span class="c7">7.8</span><span>&nbsp;the shaded areas shown depict genuine probabilities (e.g., in Figure </span><span class="c7">7.8a</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;it shows the probability of observing a value that falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean). </span></p><p class="c4"><span>Okay, so that explains part of the story. I&rsquo;ve explained a little bit about how continuous probability distributions should be interpreted (i.e., area under the curve is the key thing). But what does the formula for ppxq that I described earlier actually mean? Obviously, ppxq doesn&rsquo;t describe a probability, but what is it? The name for this quantity ppxq is a probability density, and in terms of the plots we&rsquo;ve been drawing it corresponds to the height of the curve. The densities themselves aren&rsquo;t meaningful in and of themselves, but they&rsquo;re &ldquo;rigged&rdquo; to ensure that the area under the curve is always interpretable as genuine probabilities. To be honest, that&rsquo;s about as much as you really need to know for now</span><img src="images/image5.png"></p><p class="c25"><span class="c65">7.6</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Other useful distributions </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">The normal distribution is the distribution that statistics makes most use of (for reasons to be discussed shortly), and the binomial distribution is a very useful one for lots of purposes. But the world of statistics is filled with probability distributions, some of which we&rsquo;ll run into in passing. In particular, the three that will appear in this book are the t distribution, the &chi; 2 distribution and the F distribution. I won&rsquo;t give formulas for any of these, or talk about them in too much detail, but I will show you some pictures.</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 587.00px; height: 379.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image248.png" style="width: 587.00px; height: 379.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 7.10: A t distribution with 3 degrees of freedom (solid line).

Note that the &ldquo;tails&rdquo; of the t distribution are &ldquo;heavier&rdquo; (i.e., extend further outwards) than the tails of the normal distribution). That&rsquo;s the important difference between the two. This distribution tends to arise in situations where you think that the data actually follow a normal distribution, but you don&rsquo;t know the mean or standard deviation. We&rsquo;ll run into this distribution again in Chapter </span><span class="c7">11</span><span class="c51 c52">.</span></li><li class="c4 c22 li-bullet-0"><span>The</span><span class="c61">&nbsp;&chi; 2 distribution</span><span>&nbsp;is another distribution that turns up in lots of different places. The situation in which we&rsquo;ll see it is when doing categorical data analysis (Chapter </span><span class="c7">10</span><span>), but it&rsquo;s one of those things that actually pops up all over the place. When you dig into the maths (and who doesn&rsquo;t love doing that?), it turns out that the main reason why the &chi; 2 distribution turns up all over the place is that if you have a bunch of variables that are normally distributed, square their values and then add them up (a procedure referred to as taking a &ldquo;sum of squares&rdquo;), this sum has a &chi; 2 distribution. You&rsquo;d be amazed how often this fact turns out to be useful. Anyway, here&rsquo;s what a &chi; 2 distribution looks like: Figure </span><span class="c7">7.11</span><span class="c51 c52">.</span></li><li class="c4 c22 li-bullet-0"><span>The </span><span class="c61">F distribution</span><span>&nbsp;looks a bit like a &chi; 2 distribution, and it arises whenever you need to compare two &chi; 2 distributions to one another. Admittedly, this doesn&rsquo;t exactly sound like something that any sane person would want to do, but it turns out to be very important in real world data analysis. Remember when I said that &chi; 2 turns out to be the key distribution when we&rsquo;re taking a &ldquo;sum of squares&rdquo;? Well, what that means is if you want to compare two different &ldquo;sums of squares&rdquo;, you&rsquo;re probably talking about something that has an F distribution. Of course, as yet I still haven&rsquo;t given you an example of anything that involves a sum of squares, but I will in Chapter </span><span class="c7">13</span><span>. And that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ll run into the F distribution. Oh, and there&rsquo;s a picture in Figure </span><span class="c7">7.12</span><span class="c51 c52">. </span></li></ul><p class="c4"><span>Okay, time to wrap this section up. We&rsquo;ve seen three new distributions: &chi; 2 , </span><img src="images/image183.png"><span>&nbsp;and </span><img src="images/image184.png"><span class="c51 c52">. They&rsquo;re all continuous distributions, and they&rsquo;re all closely related to the normal distribution. The main thing for our purposes is that you grasp the basic idea that these distributions are all deeply related to one another, and to the normal distribution. Later on in this book we&rsquo;re going to run into data that are normally distributed, or at least assumed to be normally distributed. What I want you to understand right now is that, if you make the assumption that your data are normally distributed, you shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see &chi; 2 , t and F distributions popping up all over the place when you start trying to do your data analysis.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c65">7.7</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Summary</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">In this chapter we&rsquo;ve talked about probability. We&rsquo;ve talked about what probability means and why statisticians can&rsquo;t agree on what it means. We talked about the rules that probabilities have to obey. And we introduced the idea of a probability distribution and spent a good chunk of the chapter talking about some of the more important probability distributions that statisticians work with. The section by section breakdown looks like this:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_y70jsq3v6hsz-0 start"><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span>Probability theory versus statistics (Section </span><span class="c7">7.1</span><span class="c51 c52">) </span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span>Frequentist versus Bayesian views of probability (Section </span><span class="c7">7.2</span><span class="c51 c52">)</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span>Basics of probability theory (Section </span><span class="c7">7.3</span><span class="c51 c52">) </span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span>Binomial distribution (Section </span><span class="c7">7.4</span><span>), normal distribution (Section</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;7.5</span><span>), and others (Section </span><span class="c52 c70 c7">7.6)</span></li></ul><p class="c4"><span>As you&rsquo;d expect, my coverage is by no means exhaustive. Probability theory is a large branch of mathematics in its own right, entirely separate from its application to statistics and data analysis. As such, there are thousands of books written on the subject and universities generally offer multiple classes devoted entirely to probability theory. Even the &ldquo;simpler&rdquo; task of documenting standard probability distributions is a big topic. I&rsquo;ve described five standard probability distributions in this chapter, but sitting on my bookshelf I have a 45-chapter book called &ldquo;Statistical Distributions&rdquo; </span><span class="c7">(Evans et al. 2011)</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;that lists a lot more than that. Fortunately for you, very little of this is necessary. You&rsquo;re unlikely to need to know dozens of statistical distributions when you go out and do real world data analysis, and you definitely won&rsquo;t need them for this book, but it never hurts to know that there&rsquo;s other possibilities out there. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Picking up on that last point, there&rsquo;s a sense in which this whole chapter is something of a digression. Many undergraduate psychology classes on statistics skim over this content very quickly (I know mine did), and even the more advanced classes will often &ldquo;forget&rdquo; to revisit the basic foundations of the field. Most academic psychologists would not know the difference between probability and density, and until recently very few would have been aware of the difference between Bayesian and frequentist probability. However, I think it&rsquo;s important to understand these things before moving onto the applications. For example, there are a lot of rules about what you&rsquo;re &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; to say when doing statistical inference and many of these can seem arbitrary and weird. However, they start to make sense if you understand that there is this Bayesian/frequentist distinction. Similarly, in Chapter 11 we&rsquo;re going to talk about something called the t-test, and if you really want to have a grasp of the mechanics of the t-test it really helps to have a sense of what a t-distribution actually looks like. You get the idea, I hope.</span></p><p class="c4 c23"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><h1 class="c42 c111" id="h.1rzw7fg7ban5"><span class="c24">8.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c58 c105 c78">Estimating unknown quantities from a sample</span></h1><p class="c15"><span>At the start of the last chapter I highlighted the critical distinction between descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. As discussed in Chapter </span><span class="c7">4</span><span>, the role of descriptive statistics is to concisely summarise what we do know. In contrast, the purpose of inferential statistics is to &ldquo;learn what we do not know from what we do&rdquo;. Now that we have a foundation in probability theory we are in a good position to think about the problem of statistical inference. What kinds of things would we like to learn about? And how do we learn them? These are the questions that lie at the heart of inferential statistics, and they are traditionally divided into two &ldquo;big ideas&rdquo;: estimation and hypothesis testing. The goal in this chapter is to introduce the first of these big ideas, estimation theory, but I&rsquo;m going to witter on about sampling theory first because estimation theory doesn&rsquo;t make sense until you understand sampling. As a consequence, this chapter divides naturally into two parts Sections </span><span class="c7">8.1</span><span>&nbsp;through </span><span class="c7">8.3</span><span>&nbsp;are focused on sampling theory, and Sections </span><span class="c7">8.4</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c7">8.5</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;make use of sampling theory to discuss how statisticians think about estimation.</span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c65">8.1</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Samples, populations and sampling</span></p><p class="c4"><span>In the prelude to Part </span><img src="images/image14.png"><span>&nbsp;I discussed the riddle of induction and highlighted the fact that all learning requires you to make assumptions. Accepting that this is true, our first task to come up with some fairly general assumptions about data that make sense. This is where </span><span class="c61">sampling theory</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;comes in. If probability theory is the foundations upon which all statistical theory builds, sampling theory is the frame around which you can build the rest of the house. Sampling theory plays a huge role in specifying the assumptions upon which your statistical inferences rely. And in order to talk about &ldquo;making inferences&rdquo; the way statisticians think about it we need to be a bit more explicit about what it is that we&rsquo;re drawing inferences from (the sample) and what it is that we&rsquo;re drawing inferences about (the population). </span></p><p class="c4"><span>In almost every situation of interest what we have available to us as researchers is a </span><span class="c61">sample</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;of data. We might have run experiment with some number of participants, a polling company might have phoned some number of people to ask questions about voting intentions, and so on. In this way the data set available to us is finite and incomplete. We can&rsquo;t possibly get every person in the world to do our experiment, for example a polling company doesn&rsquo;t have the time or the money to ring up every voter in the country. In our earlier discussion of descriptive statistics (Chapter 4) this sample was the only thing we were interested in. Our only goal was to find ways of describing, summarising and graphing that sample. This is about to change.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">8.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defining a population</span></p><p class="c4"><span>A sample is a concrete thing. You can open up a data file and there&rsquo;s the data from your sample. A </span><span class="c61">population</span><span class="c51 c52">, on the other hand, is a more abstract idea. It refers to the set of all possible people, or all possible observations, that you want to draw conclusions about and is generally much bigger than the sample. In an ideal world the researcher would begin the study with a clear idea of what the population of interest is, since the process of designing a study and testing hypotheses with the data does depend on the population about which you want to make statements.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Sometimes it&rsquo;s easy to state the population of interest. For instance, in the &ldquo;polling company&rdquo; example that opened the chapter the population consisted of all voters enrolled at the time of the study, millions of people. The sample was a set of 1000 people who all belong to that population. In most studies the situation is much less straightforward. In a typical psychological experiment determining the population of interest is a bit more complicated. Suppose I run an experiment using 100 undergraduate students as my participants. My goal, as a cognitive scientist, is to try to learn something about how the mind works. So, which of the following would count as &ldquo;the population&rdquo;:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_ko0tt4tl2dji-0 start"><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">All of the undergraduate psychology students at the University of Adelaide?</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Undergraduate psychology students in general, anywhere in the world?</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Australians currently living?</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Australians of similar ages to my sample?</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Anyone currently alive?</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Any human being, past, present or future?</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Any biological organism with a sufficient degree of intelligence operating in a terrestrial environment?</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Any intelligent being?</span></li></ul><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Each of these defines a real group of mind-possessing entities, all of which might be of interest to me as a cognitive scientist, and it&rsquo;s not at all clear which one ought to be the true population of interest. As another example, consider the Wellesley-Croker game that we discussed in the prelude. The sample here is a specific sequence of 12 wins and 0 losses for Wellesley. What is the population?</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_bzbnvor8qumy-0 start"><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">All outcomes until Wellesley and Croker arrived at their destination?</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">All outcomes if Wellesley and Croker had played the game for the rest of their lives?</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">All outcomes if Wellseley and Croker lived forever and played the game until the world ran out of hills?</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">All outcomes if we created an infinite set of parallel universes and the Wellesely/Croker pair made guesses about the same 12 hills in each universe?</span></li></ul><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">8.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple random samples</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Irrespective of how I define the population, the critical point is that the sample is a subset of the population and our goal is to use our knowledge of the sample to draw inferences about the properties of the population. The relationship between the two depends on the procedure by which the sample was selected. This procedure is referred to as a </span><span class="c61">sampling method</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;and it is important to understand why it matters. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>To keep things simple, let&rsquo;s imagine that we have a bag containing 10 chips. Each chip has a unique letter printed on it so we can distinguish between the 10 chips. The chips come in two colours, black and white. This set of chips is the population of interest and it is depicted graphically on the left of Figure </span><span class="c7">8.1</span><span>. As you can see from looking at the picture there are 4 black chips and 6 white chips, but of course in real life we wouldn&rsquo;t know that unless we looked in the bag. Now imagine you run the following &ldquo;experiment&rdquo;: you shake up the bag, close your eyes, and pull out 4 chips without putting any of them back into the bag. First out comes the a chip (black), then the c chip (white), then j (white) and then finally b (black). If you wanted you could then put all the chips back in the bag and repeat the experiment, as depicted on the right hand side of Figure </span><span class="c7">8.1</span><span>. Each time you get different results but the procedure is identical in each case.

Suppose that my 5-year old son had opened the bag and decided to pull out four black chips without putting any of them back in the bag. This biased sampling scheme is depicted in Figure </span><span class="c102">8.2</span><span>. Now consider the evidential value of seeing 4 black chips and 0 white chips. Clearly it depends on the sampling scheme, does it not? If you know that the sampling scheme is biased to select only black chips then a sample that consists of only black chips doesn&rsquo;t tell you very much about the population! For this reason statisticians really like it when a data set can be considered a simple random sample, because it makes the data analysis </span><span class="c10">much</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;easier. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>A third procedure is worth mentioning. This time around we close our eyes, shake the bag, and pull out a chip. This time, however, we record the observation and then put the chip back in the bag. Again we close our eyes, shake the bag, and pull out a chip. We then repeat this procedure until we have 4 chips. Data sets generated in this way are still simple random samples, but because we put the chips back in the bag immediately after drawing them it is referred to as a sample </span><span class="c61">with replacement</span><span>. The difference between this situation and the first one is that it is possible to observe the same population member multiple times, as illustrated in Figure </span><span class="c7">8.3</span><span class="c51 c52">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">In my experience, most psychology experiments tend to be sampling without replacement, because the same person is not allowed to participate in the experiment twice. However, most statistical theory is based on the assumption that the data arise from a simple random sample with replacement. In real life this very rarely matters. If the population of interest is large (e.g., has more than 10 entities!) the difference between sampling with- and without- replacement is too small to be concerned with. The difference between simple random samples and biased samples, on the other hand, is not such an easy thing to dismiss.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">8.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most samples are not simple random samples</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">As you can see from looking at the list of possible populations that I showed above, it is almost impossible to obtain a simple random sample from most populations of interest. When I run experiments I&rsquo;d consider it a minor miracle if my participants turned out to be a random sampling of the undergraduate psychology students at Adelaide university, even though this is by far the narrowest population that I might want to generalise to. A thorough discussion of other types of sampling schemes is beyond the scope of this book, but to give you a sense of what&rsquo;s out there I&rsquo;ll list a few of the more important ones. </span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_8sl76wvjupm0-0 start"><li class="c4 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">Stratified sampling</span><span>. Suppose your population is (or can be) divided into several different sub-populations, or strata. Perhaps you&rsquo;re running a study at several different sites, for example. Instead of trying to sample randomly from the population as a whole, you instead try to collect a separate random sample from each of the strata. Stratified sampling is sometimes easier to do than simple random sampling, especially when the population is already divided into the distinct strata. It can also be more efficient than simple random sampling, especially when some of the sub-populations are rare. For instance, when studying schizophrenia it would be much better to divide the population into two</span><img src="images/image2.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;strata (schizophrenic and not-schizophrenic) and then sample an equal number of people from each group. If you selected people randomly you would get so few schizophrenic people in the sample that your study would be useless.</span></li></ul><hr><p class="c4 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4"><img src="images/image2.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c34">Nothing in life is that simple. There&rsquo;s not an obvious division of people into binary categories like &ldquo;schizophrenic&rdquo; and &ldquo;not schizophrenic&rdquo;. But this isn&rsquo;t a clinical psychology text so please forgive me a few simplifications here and there.</span></p><p class="c4 c23"><span class="c1 c34"></span></p><p class="c4 c40"><span>This specific kind of of stratified sampling is referred to as oversampling because it makes a deliberate attempt to over-represent rare groups. </span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_8sl76wvjupm0-0"><li class="c4 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">Snowball sampling</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;is a technique that is especially useful when sampling from a &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; or hard to access population and is especially common in social sciences. For instance, suppose the researchers want to conduct an opinion poll among transgender people. The research team might only have contact details for a few trans folks, so the survey starts by asking them to participate (stage 1). At the end of the survey the participants are asked to provide contact details for other people who might want to participate. In stage 2 those new contacts are surveyed. The process continues until the researchers have sufficient data. The big advantage to snowball sampling is that it gets you data in situations that might otherwise be impossible to get any. On the statistical side, the main disadvantage is that the sample is highly non-random, and non-random in ways that are difficult to address. On the real life side, the disadvantage is that the procedure can be unethical if not handled well, because hidden populations are often hidden for a reason. I chose transgender people as an example here to highlight this issue. If you weren&rsquo;t careful you might end up outing people who don&rsquo;t want to be outed (very, very bad form), and even if you don&rsquo;t make that mistake it can still be intrusive to use people&rsquo;s social networks to study them. It&rsquo;s certainly very hard to get people&rsquo;s informed consent before contacting them, yet in many cases the simple act of contacting them and saying &ldquo;hey we want to study you&rdquo; can be hurtful. Social networks are complex things, and just because you can use them to get data doesn&rsquo;t always mean you should.</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">Convenience sampling</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;is more or less what it sounds like. The samples are chosen in a way that is convenient to the researcher, and not selected at random from the population of interest. Snowball sampling is one type of convenience sampling, but there are many others. A common example in psychology are studies that rely on undergraduate psychology students. These samples are generally non-random in two respects. First, reliance on undergraduate psychology students automatically means that your data are restricted to a single sub-population. Second, the students usually get to pick which studies they participate in, so the sample is a self selected subset of psychology students and not a randomly selected subset. In real life most studies are convenience samples of one form or another. This is sometimes a severe limitation, but not always. </span></li></ul><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">8.1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much does it matter if you don&rsquo;t have a simple random sample?</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Okay, so real world data collection tends not to involve nice simple random samples. Does that matter? A little thought should make it clear to you that it can matter if your data are not a simple random sample. Just think about the difference between Figures </span><span class="c7">8.1</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c7">8.2</span><span class="c51 c52">. However, it&rsquo;s not quite as bad as it sounds. Some types of biased samples are entirely unproblematic. For instance, when using a stratified sampling technique you actually know what the bias is because you created it deliberately, often to increase the effectiveness of your study, and there are statistical techniques that you can use to adjust for the biases you&rsquo;ve introduced (not covered in this book!). So in those situations it&rsquo;s not a problem. More generally though, it&rsquo;s important to remember that random sampling is a means to an end, and not the end in itself. Let&rsquo;s assume you&rsquo;ve relied on a convenience sample, and as such you can assume it&rsquo;s biased. A bias in your sampling method is only a problem if it causes you to draw the wrong conclusions. When viewed from that perspective, I&rsquo;d argue that we don&rsquo;t need the sample to be randomly generated in every respect, we only need it to be random with respect to the psychologically-relevant phenomenon of interest. Suppose I&rsquo;m doing a study looking at working memory capacity. In study 1, I actually have the ability to sample randomly from all human beings currently alive, with one exception: I can only sample people born on a Monday. In study 2, I am able to sample randomly from the Australian population. I want to generalise my results to the population of all living humans. Which study is better? The answer, obviously, is study 1. Why? Because we have no reason to think that being &ldquo;born on a Monday&rdquo; has any interesting relationship to working memory capacity. In contrast, I can think of several reasons why &ldquo;being Australian&rdquo; might matter. Australia is a wealthy, industrialised country with a very well-developed education system. People growing up in that system will have had life experiences much more similar to the experiences of the people who designed the tests for working memory capacity. This shared experience might easily translate into similar beliefs about how to &ldquo;take a test&rdquo;, a shared assumption about how psychological experimentation works, and so on. These things might actually matter. For instance, &ldquo;test taking&rdquo; style might have taught the Australian participants how to direct their attention exclusively on fairly abstract test materials much more than people who haven&rsquo;t grown up in a similar environment. This could therefore lead to a misleading picture of what working memory capacity is.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">There are two points hidden in this discussion. First, when designing your own studies, it&rsquo;s important to think about what population you care about and try hard to sample in a way that is appropriate to that population. In practice, you&rsquo;re usually forced to put up with a &ldquo;sample of convenience&rdquo; (e.g., psychology lecturers sample psychology students because that&rsquo;s the least expensive way to collect data, and our coffers aren&rsquo;t exactly overflowing with gold), but if so you should at least spend some time thinking about what the dangers of this practice might be. Second, if you&rsquo;re going to criticise someone else&rsquo;s study because they&rsquo;ve used a sample of convenience rather than laboriously sampling randomly from the entire human population, at least have the courtesy to offer a specific theory as to how this might have distorted the results.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">8.1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Population parameters and sample statistics</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Okay. Setting aside the thorny methodological issues associated with obtaining a random sample, let&rsquo;s consider a slightly different issue. Up to this point we have been talking about populations the way a scientist might. To a psychologist a population might be a group of people. To an ecologist a population might be a group of bears. In most cases the populations that scientists care about are concrete things that actually exist in the real world. Statisticians, however, are a funny lot. On the one hand, they are interested in real world data and real science in the same way that scientists are. On the other hand, they also operate in the realm of pure abstraction in the way that mathematicians do. As a consequence, statistical theory tends to be a bit abstract in how a population is defined. In much the same way that psychological researchers operationalise our abstract theoretical ideas in terms of concrete measurements (Section </span><span class="c7">2.1</span><span>), statisticians operationalise the concept of a &ldquo;population&rdquo; in terms of mathematical objects that they know how to work with. You&rsquo;ve already come across these objects in Chapter </span><span class="c7">7</span><span class="c51 c52">. They&rsquo;re called probability distributions. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>The idea is quite simple. Let&rsquo;s say we&rsquo;re talking about IQ scores. To a psychologist the population of interest is a group of actual humans who have IQ scores. A statistician &ldquo;simplifies&rdquo; this by operationally defining the population as the probability distribution depicted in Figure 8.4a. IQ tests are designed so that the average IQ is 100, the standard deviation of IQ scores is 15, and the distribution of IQ scores is normal. These values are referred to as the </span><span class="c61">population parameters</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;because they are characteristics of the entire population. That is, we say that the population mean &micro; is 100 and the population standard deviation &sigma; is 15.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">Now suppose I run an experiment. I select 100 people at random and administer an IQ test, giving me a simple random sample from the population. My sample would consist of a collection of numbers like this:</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c51 c52">106 101 98 80 74 ... 107 72 100</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 627.07px; height: 212.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image281.png" style="width: 627.07px; height: 212.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 8.4: The population distribution of IQ scores (panel a) and two samples drawn randomly from it. In panel b we have a sample of 100 observations, and panel c we have a sample of 10,000 observations.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span>Each of these IQ scores is sampled from a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 15. So if I plot a histogram of the sample I get something like the one shown in Figure </span><span class="c7">8.4b</span><span>. As you can see, the histogram is roughly the right shape but it&rsquo;s a very crude approximation to the true population distribution shown in Figure </span><span class="c7">8.4a</span><span>. When I calculate the mean of my sample, I get a number that is fairly close to the population mean 100 but not identical. In this case, it turns out that the people in my sample have a mean IQ of 98.5, and the standard deviation of their IQ scores is 15.9. These </span><span class="c61">sample statistics</span><span>&nbsp;are properties of my data set, and although they are fairly similar to the true population values they are not the same. In general, sample statistics are the things you can calculate from your data set and the population parameters are the things you want to learn about. Later on in this chapter I&rsquo;ll talk about how you can estimate population parameters using your sample statistics (Section </span><span class="c7">8.4</span><span>) and how to work out how confident you are in your estimates (Section </span><span class="c7">8.5</span><span class="c51 c52">) but before we get to that there&rsquo;s a few more ideas in sampling theory that you need to know about.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c65">8.2</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">The law of large numbers</span></p><p class="c4"><span>In the previous section I showed you the results of one fictitious </span><img src="images/image185.png"><span>&nbsp;experiment with a sample size of </span><img src="images/image172.png"><span class="c51 c52">. The results were somewhat encouraging as the true population mean is 100 and the sample mean of 98.5 is a pretty reasonable approximation to it. In many scientific studies that level of precision is perfectly acceptable, but in other situations you need to be a lot more precise. If we want our sample statistics to be much closer to the population parameters, what can we do about it?</span></p><p class="c4"><span>The obvious answer is to collect more data. Suppose that we ran a much larger experiment, this time measuring the IQs of 10,000 people. We can simulate the results of this experiment using jamovi. The IQsim.omv file is a jamovi data file. In this file I have generated 10,000 random numbers sampled from a normal distribution for a population with mean = 100 and sd = 15. This was done by computing a new variable using the = NORM(100,15) function. A histogram and density plot shows that this larger sample is a much better approximation to the true population distribution than the smaller one. This is reflected in the sample statistics. The mean IQ for the larger sample turns out to be 99.68 and the standard deviation is 14.90. These values are now very close to the true population. See Figure</span><span class="c52 c70 c7">&nbsp;8.5 </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">I feel a bit silly saying this, but the thing I want you to take away from this is that large samples generally give you better information. I feel silly saying it because it&rsquo;s so bloody obvious that it shouldn&rsquo;t need to be said. In fact, it&rsquo;s such an obvious point that when Jacob Bernoulli, one of the founders of probability theory, formalised this idea back in 1713 he was kind of a jerk about it. Here&rsquo;s how he described the fact that we all share this intuition:</span></p><p class="c4 c40"><span>For even the most stupid of men, by some instinct of nature, by himself and without any instruction (which is a remarkable thing), is convinced that the more observations have been made, the less danger there is of wandering from one&rsquo;s goal (see </span><span class="c7">Stigler 1986</span><span class="c51 c52">, p65)</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Okay, so the passage comes across as a bit condescending (not to mention sexist), but his main point is correct. It really does feel obvious that more data will give you better answers. The question is, why is this so? Not surprisingly, this intuition that we all share turns out to be correct, and statisticians refer to it as the</span><span class="c61">&nbsp;law of large numbers</span><span>. The law of large numbers is a mathematical law that applies to many different sample statistics but the simplest way to think about it is as a law about averages. The sample mean is the most obvious example of a statistic that relies on averaging (because that&rsquo;s what the mean is... an average), so let&rsquo;s look at that. When applied to the sample mean what the law of large numbers states is that as the sample gets larger, the sample mean tends to get closer to the true population mean. Or, to say it a little bit more precisely, as the sample size &ldquo;approaches&rdquo; infinity (written as N </span><img src="images/image186.png"><img src="images/image187.png"><span>), the sample mean approaches the population mean </span><img src="images/image188.png"><img src="images/image180.png"></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">I don&rsquo;t intend to subject you to a proof that the law of large numbers is true, but it&rsquo;s one of the most important tools for statistical theory. The law of large numbers is the thing we can use to justify our belief that collecting more and more data will eventually lead us to the truth. For any particular data set the sample statistics that we calculate from it will be wrong, but the law of large numbers tells us that if we keep collecting more data those sample statistics will tend to get closer and closer to the true population parameters. </span></p><p class="c4 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><hr><p class="c4 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4"><img src="images/image4.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c34">Technically, the law of large numbers pertains to any sample statistic that can be described as an average of independent quantities. That&rsquo;s certainly true for the sample mean. However, it&rsquo;s also possible to write many other sample statistics as averages of one form or another. The variance of a sample, for instance, can be rewritten as a kind of average and so is subject to the law of large numbers. The minimum value of a sample, however, cannot be written as an average of anything and is therefore not governed by the law of large numbers.</span></p><p class="c25"><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 627.07px; height: 710.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image241.png" style="width: 627.07px; height: 710.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 8.5: A random sample drawn from a normal distribution using jamovi </span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c65">8.3</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Sampling distributions and the central limit theorem</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">The law of large numbers is a very powerful tool but it&rsquo;s not going to be good enough to answer all our questions.

Not surprisingly, this is much less accurate than the previous experiment. Now imagine that I decided to </span><span class="c61">replicate</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;the experiment. That is, I repeat the procedure as closely as possible and I randomly sample 5 new people and measure their IQ. Again, jamovi allows me to simulate the results of this procedure, and generates these five numbers:</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">78 88 111 111 117</span></p><p class="c4"><span>This time around, the mean IQ in my sample is 101.

Every time I replicate the experiment I write down the sample mean. Over time, I&rsquo;d be amassing a new data set, in which every experiment generates a single data point. The first 10 observations from my data set are the sample means listed in Table </span><span class="c7">8.1</span><span class="c51 c52">, so my data set starts out like this:</span></p><p class="c43

Over time, I&rsquo;d be amassing a new data set, in which every experiment generates a single data point. The first 10 observations from my data set are the sample means listed in Table 8.1, so my data set starts out like this:</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">95.0 101.0 101.6 103.8 104.4 &hellip;</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>What if I continued like this for 10,000 replications, and then drew a histogram. Well that&rsquo;s exactly what I did, and you can see the results in Figure 8.6. As this picture illustrates, the average of 5 IQ scores is usually between 90 and 110. But more importantly, what it highlights is that if we replicate an experiment over and over again, what we end up with is a distribution of sample means! This distribution has a special name in statistics, it&rsquo;s called the </span><span class="c61">sampling distribution of the mean</span><span class="c51 c52">. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>Sampling distributions are another important theoretical idea in statistics, and they&rsquo;re crucial for understanding the behaviour of small samples. For instance, when I ran the very first &ldquo;five IQ scores&rdquo; experiment, the sample mean turned out to be 95. What the sampling distribution in Figure </span><span class="c7">8.6</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;tells us, though, is that the &ldquo;five IQ scores&rdquo; experiment is not very accurate. If I repeat the experiment, the sampling distribution tells me that I can expect to see a sample mean anywhere between 80 and 120.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">8.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sampling distributions exist for any sample statistic!</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">One thing to keep in mind when thinking about sampling distributions is that any sample statistic you might care to calculate has a sampling distribution. For example, suppose that each time I replicated the &ldquo;five IQ scores&rdquo; experiment I wrote down the largest IQ score in the experiment. This would give me a data set that started out like this:</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c51 c52">110 117 122 119 113 &hellip;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Doing this over and over again would give me a very different sampling distribution, namely the sampling distribution of the maximum. The sampling distribution of the maximum of 5 IQ scores is shown in Figure 8.7. Not surprisingly, if you pick 5 people at random and then find the person with the highest IQ score, they&rsquo;re going to have an above average IQ. Most of the time you&rsquo;ll end up with someone whose IQ is measured in the 100 to 140 range.</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 452.00px; height: 378.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image288.png" style="width: 452.00px; height: 378.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 8.6: The sampling distribution of the mean for the &ldquo;five IQ scores experiment&rdquo;.

In each panel I generated 10,000 samples of IQ data and calculated the mean IQ observed within each of these data sets. The histograms in these plots show the distribution of these means (i.e., the sampling distribution of the mean). Each individual IQ score was drawn from a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 15, which is shown as the solid black line. In panel a, each data set contained only a single observation, so the mean of each sample is just one person&rsquo;s IQ score. As a consequence, the sampling distribution of the mean is of course identical to the population distribution of IQ scores. However, when we raise the sample size to 2 the mean of any one sample tends to be closer to the population mean than a one person&rsquo;s IQ score, and so the histogram (i.e., the sampling distribution) is a bit narrower than the population distribution. By the time we raise the sample size to 10 (panel c), we can see that the distribution of sample means tend to be fairly tightly clustered around the true population mean. </span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">8.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central limit theorem</span></p><p class="c4"><span>At this point I hope you have a pretty good sense of what sampling distributions are, and in particular what the sampling distribution of the mean is. In this section I want to talk about how the sampling distribution of the mean changes as a function of sample size. Intuitively, you already know part of the answer. If you only have a few observations, the sample mean is likely to be quite inaccurate. If you replicate a small experiment and recalculate the mean you&rsquo;ll get a very different answer. In other words, the sampling distribution is quite wide. If you replicate a large experiment and recalculate the sample mean you&rsquo;ll probably get the same answer you got last time, so the sampling distribution will be very narrow. You can see this visually in Figure </span><span class="c7">8.8</span><span>, showing that the bigger the sample size, the narrower the sampling distribution gets. We can quantify this effect by calculating the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, which is referred to as the </span><span class="c61">standard error</span><span class="c51 c52">. The standard error of a statistic is often denoted SE, and since we&rsquo;re usually interested in the standard error of the sample mean, we often use the acronym SEM. As you can see just by looking at the picture, as the sample size N increases, the SEM decreases.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Okay, so that&rsquo;s one part of the story. However, there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve been glossing over so far. All my examples up to this point have been based on the &ldquo;IQ scores&rdquo; experiments, and because IQ scores are roughly normally distributed I&rsquo;ve assumed that the population distribution is normal. What if it isn&rsquo;t normal? What happens to the sampling distribution of the mean? The remarkable thing is this, no matter what shape your population distribution is, as </span><img src="images/image56.png"><span>&nbsp;increases the sampling distribution of the mean starts to look more like a normal distribution. To give you a sense of this I ran some simulations. To do this, I started with the &ldquo;ramped&rdquo; distribution shown in the histogram in Figure </span><span class="c7">8.9</span><span>. As you can see by comparing the triangular shaped histogram to the bell curve plotted by the black line, the population distribution doesn&rsquo;t look very much like a normal distribution at all. Next, I simulated the results of a large number of experiments. In each experiment I took </span><img src="images/image189.png"><span>&nbsp;samples from this distribution, and then calculated the sample mean. Figure </span><span class="c7">8.9b</span><span>&nbsp;plots the histogram of these sample means (i.e., the sampling distribution of the mean for </span><img src="images/image189.png"><span>&nbsp;). This time, the histogram produces an X-shaped distribution. It&rsquo;s still not normal, but it&rsquo;s a lot closer to the black line than the population distribution in Figure </span><span class="c7">8.9a</span><span>. When I increase the sample size to </span><img src="images/image190.png"><span>&nbsp;, the sampling distribution of the mean is very close to normal (Figure </span><span class="c7">8.9c</span><span>), and by the time we reach a sample size of </span><img src="images/image191.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;it&rsquo;s almost perfectly normal. In other words, as long as your sample size isn&rsquo;t tiny, the sampling distribution of the mean will be approximately normal no matter what your population distribution looks like!</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">On the basis of these figures, it seems like we have evidence for all of the following claims about the sampling distribution of the mean. </span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_4v7r8zqziykh-0 start"><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">The mean of the sampling distribution is the same as the mean of the population</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">The standard deviation of the sampling distribution (i.e., the standard error) gets smaller as the sample size increases</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">The shape of the sampling distribution becomes normal as the sample size increases</span></li></ul><p class="c25"><span>As it happens, not only are all of these statements true, there is a very famous theorem in statistics that proves all three of them, known as the central limit theorem. Among other things, the </span><span class="c61">central limit theorem</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;tells us that if the population distribution has mean &micro; and standard deviation &sigma;, then the sampling distribution of the mean also has mean &micro; and the standard error of the mean is</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><img src="images/image192.png"></p><p class="c25"><span>Because we divide the population standard deviation &sigma; by the square root of the sample size N, the SEM gets smaller as the sample size increases. It also tells us that the shape of the sampling distribution becomes normal</span><img src="images/image193.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">This result is useful for all sorts of things. It tells us why large experiments are more reliable than small ones, and because it gives us an explicit formula for the standard error it tells us how much more reliable a large experiment is. It tells us why the normal distribution is, well, normal. In real experiments, many of the things that we want to measure are actually averages of lots of different quantities (e.g., arguably, &ldquo;general&rdquo; intelligence as measured by IQ is an average of a large number of &ldquo;specific&rdquo; skills and abilities), and when that happens, the averaged quantity should follow a normal distribution. Because of this mathematical law, the normal distribution pops up over and over again in real data.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image5.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;As usual, I&rsquo;m being a bit sloppy here. The central limit theorem is a bit more general than this section implies. Like most introductory stats texts I&rsquo;ve discussed one situation where the central limit theorem holds: when you&rsquo;re taking an average across lots of independent events drawn from the same distribution. However, the central limit theorem is much broader than this. There&rsquo;s a whole class of things called &ldquo;U-statistics&rdquo; for instance, all of which satisfy the central limit theorem and therefore become normally distributed for large sample sizes. The mean is one such statistic, but it&rsquo;s not the only one.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 627.07px; height: 685.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image287.png" style="width: 627.07px; height: 685.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 8.9: A demonstration of the central limit theorem.

As every undergraduate gets taught in their very first lecture on the measurement of intelligence, IQ scores are defined to have mean 100 and standard deviation 15. However, this is a bit of a lie. How do we know that IQ scores have a true population mean of 100? Well, we know this because the people who designed the tests have administered them to very large samples, and have then &ldquo;rigged&rdquo; the scoring rules so that their sample has mean 100. That&rsquo;s not a bad thing of course, it&rsquo;s an important part of designing a psychological measurement. However, it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that this theoretical mean of 100 only attaches to the population that the test designers used to design the tests. Good test designers will actually go to some lengths to provide &ldquo;test norms&rdquo; that can apply to lots of different populations (e.g., different age groups, nationalities etc). </span></p><p class="c25"><span>This is very handy, but of course almost every research project of interest involves looking at a different population of people to those used in the test norms. For instance, suppose you wanted to measure the effect of low level lead poisoning on cognitive functioning in Port Pirie, a South Australian industrial town with a lead smelter. Perhaps you decide that you want to compare IQ scores among people in Port Pirie to a comparable sample in Whyalla, a South Australian industrial town with a steel refinery</span><img src="images/image194.png"><span>&nbsp; Regardless of which town you&rsquo;re thinking about, it doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense simply to assume that the true population mean IQ is 100. No-one has, to my knowledge, produced sensible norming data that can automatically be applied to South Australian industrial towns. We&rsquo;re going to have to </span><span class="c61">estimate</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;the population parameters from a sample of data. So how do we do this?</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">8.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimating the population mean</span></p><p class="c25"><span>Suppose we go to Port Pirie and 100 of the locals are kind enough to sit through an IQ test. The average IQ score among these people turns out to be </span><img src="images/image195.png"><span class="c51 c52">. So what is the true mean IQ for the entire population of Port Pirie? Obviously, we don&rsquo;t know the answer to that question. It could be 97.2, but it could also be 103.5. Our sampling isn&rsquo;t exhaustive so we cannot give a definitive answer. Nevertheless, if I was forced at gunpoint to give a &ldquo;best guess&rdquo; I&rsquo;d have to say 98.5. That&rsquo;s the essence of statistical estimation: giving a best guess.</span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c35 c42"><img src="images/image196.png"><span class="c79">Please note that if you were actually interested in this question you would need to be a lot more careful than I&rsquo;m being here. You can&rsquo;t just compare IQ scores in Whyalla to Port Pirie and assume that any differences are due to lead poisoning. Even if it were true that the only differences between the two towns corresponded to the different refineries (and it isn&rsquo;t, not by a long shot), you need to account for the fact that people already believe that lead pollution causes cognitive deficits. If you recall back to Chapter 2, this means that there are different demand effects for the Port Pirie sample than for the Whyalla sample. In other words, you might end up with an illusory group difference in your data, caused by the fact that people think that there is a real difference. I find it pretty implausible to think that the locals wouldn&rsquo;t be well aware of what you were trying to do if a bunch of researchers turned up in Port Pirie with lab coats and IQ tests, and even less plausible to think that a lot of people would be pretty resentful of you for doing it. Those people won&rsquo;t be as co-operative in the tests. Other people in Port Pirie might be more motivated to do well because they don&rsquo;t want their home town to look bad. The motivational effects that would apply in Whyalla are likely to be weaker, because people don&rsquo;t have any concept of &ldquo;iron ore poisoning&rdquo; in the same way that they have a concept for &ldquo;lead poisoning&rdquo;. Psychology is hard.</span></p><p class="c25"><span>In this example estimating the unknown poulation parameter is straightforward. I calculate the sample mean and I use that as my </span><span class="c61">estimate of the population mean</span><span>. It&rsquo;s pretty simple, and in the next section I&rsquo;ll explain the statistical justification for this intuitive answer. However, for the moment what I want to do is make sure you recognise that the sample statistic and the estimate of the population parameter are conceptually different things. A sample statistic is a description of your data, whereas the estimate is a guess about the population. With that in mind, statisticians often different notation to refer to them. For instance, if the true population mean is denoted &micro;, then we would use </span><img src="images/image197.png"><span>to refer to our estimate of the population mean. In contrast, the sample mean is denoted </span><img src="images/image28.png"><span>&nbsp;or sometimes m. However, in simple random samples the estimate of the population mean is identical to the sample mean. If I observe a sample mean of </span><img src="images/image195.png"><span>then my estimate of the population mean is also </span><img src="images/image198.png"><span class="c51 c52">. To help keep the notation clear, here&rsquo;s a handy table:</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><a id="t.c4df86bf0b42143c262cc78eb0c9cff729f01427"></a><a id="t.24"></a><table class="c74"><tbody><tr class="c11"><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">Symbol</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">What is it?</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Do we know what it is?</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image28.png"></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">Sample mean</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">Yes, calculated from the raw data</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image199.png"></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">True population mean</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">Almost never known for sure</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image197.png"></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">Estimate of the population mean</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">Yes, identical to the sample mean in simple random samples</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">8.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimating the population standard deviation</span></p><p class="c4"><span>So far, estimation seems pretty simple, and you might be wondering why I forced you to read through all that stuff about sampling theory. In the case of the mean our estimate of the population parameter (i.e.</span><img src="images/image197.png"><span>) turned out to identical to the corresponding sample statistic (i.e. </span><img src="images/image28.png"><span>). However, that&rsquo;s not always true. To see this, let&rsquo;s have a think about how to construct an </span><span class="c61">estimate of the population standard deviation</span><span>, which we&rsquo;ll denote </span><img src="images/image59.png"><span class="c51 c52">. What shall we use as our estimate in this case? Your first thought might be that we could do the same thing we did when estimating the mean, and just use the sample statistic as our estimate. That&rsquo;s almost the right thing to do, but not quite. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Here&rsquo;s why. Suppose I have a sample that contains a single observation. For this example, it helps to consider a sample where you have no intuitions at all about what the true population values might be, so let&rsquo;s use something completely fictitious. Suppose the observation in question measures the cromulence of my shoes. It turns out that my shoes have a cromulence of 20. So here&rsquo;s my sample:</span></p><p class="c4"><span>This is a perfectly legitimate sample, even if it does have a sample size of </span><img src="images/image200.png"><span>. It has a sample mean of 20 and because every observation in this sample is equal to the sample mean (obviously!) it has a sample standard deviation of 0. As a description of the sample this seems quite right, the sample contains a single observation and therefore there is no variation observed within the sample. A sample standard deviation of </span><img src="images/image201.png"><span>&nbsp;is the right answer here. But as an estimate of the population standard deviation it feels completely insane, right? Admittedly, you and I don&rsquo;t know anything at all about what &ldquo;cromulence&rdquo; is, but we know something about data. The only reason that we don&rsquo;t see any variability in the sample is that the sample is too small to display any variation! So, if you have a sample size of </span><img src="images/image200.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;it feels like the right answer is just to say &ldquo;no idea at all&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Notice that you don&rsquo;t have the same intuition when it comes to the sample mean and the population mean. If forced to make a best guess about the population mean it doesn&rsquo;t feel completely insane to guess that the population mean is 20. Sure, you probably wouldn&rsquo;t feel very confident in that guess because you have only the one observation to work with, but it&rsquo;s still the best guess you can make.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Let&rsquo;s extend this example a little. Suppose I now make a second observation. My data set now has </span><img src="images/image189.png"><span class="c51 c52">observations of the cromulence of shoes, and the complete sample now looks like this:</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c51 c52">20, 22</span></p><p class="c4"><span>This time around, our sample is just large enough for us to be able to observe some variability: two observations is the bare minimum number needed for any variability to be observed! For our new data set, the sample mean is </span><img src="images/image202.png"><span>, and the sample standard deviation is </span><img src="images/image203.png"><span class="c51 c52">. What intuitions do we have about the population? Again, as far as the population mean goes, the best guess we can possibly make is the sample mean. If forced to guess we&rsquo;d probably guess that the population mean cromulence is 21. What about the standard deviation? This is a little more complicated. The sample standard deviation is only based on two observations, and if you&rsquo;re at all like me you probably have the intuition that, with only two observations we haven&rsquo;t given the population &ldquo;enough of a chance&rdquo; to reveal its true variability to us. It&rsquo;s not just that we suspect that the estimate is wrong, after all with only two observations we expect it to be wrong to some degree. The worry is that the error is systematic. Specifically, we suspect that the sample standard deviation is likely to be smaller than the population standard deviation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>This intuition feels right, but it would be nice to demonstrate this somehow. There are in fact mathematical proofs that confirm this intuition, but unless you have the right mathematical background they don&rsquo;t help very much. Instead, what I&rsquo;ll do is simulate the results of some experiments. With that in mind, let&rsquo;s return to our IQ studies. Suppose the true population mean IQ is 100 and the standard deviation is 15. First I&rsquo;ll conduct an experiment in which I measure </span><img src="images/image189.png"><span>&nbsp;IQ scores and I&rsquo;ll calculate the sample standard deviation. If I do this over and over again, and plot a histogram of these sample standard deviations, what I have is the sampling distribution of the standard deviation. I&rsquo;ve plotted this distribution in Figure</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;8.10</span><span>. Even though the true population standard deviation is 15 the average of the sample standard deviations is only 8.5. Notice that this is a very different result to what we found in Figure</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;8.8b </span><span class="c51 c52">when we plotted the sampling distribution of the mean, where the population mean is 100 and the average of the sample means is also 100.</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 570.00px; height: 624.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image297.png" style="width: 570.00px; height: 624.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 8.10: The sampling distribution of the sample standard deviation for a &ldquo;two IQ scores&rdquo; experiment. The true population standard deviation is 15 (dashed line), but as you can see from the histogram the vast majority of experiments will produce a much smaller sample standard deviation than this. On average, this experiment would produce a sample standard deviation of only 8.5, well below the true value! In other words, the sample standard deviation is a biased estimate of the population standard deviation.</span></p><hr><p class="c4 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span>Now let&rsquo;s extend the simulation. Instead of restricting ourselves to the situation where </span><img src="images/image189.png"><span>&nbsp;, let&rsquo;s repeat the exercise for sample sizes from 1 to 10. If we plot the average sample mean and average sample standard deviation as a function of sample size, you get the results shown in Figure</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;8.11</span><span>. On the left hand side (panel a) I&rsquo;ve plotted the average sample mean and on the right hand side (panel b) I&rsquo;ve plotted the average standard deviation. The two plots are quite different:on average, the average sample mean is equal to the population mean.

It is a </span><span class="c61">biased estimator</span><span>. In other words, if we want to make a &ldquo;best guess&rdquo; </span><img src="images/image59.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;about the value of the population standard deviation &sigma; we should make sure our guess is a little bit larger than the sample standard deviation s.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 627.07px; height: 325.33px;"><img alt="" src="images/image283.png" style="width: 627.07px; height: 325.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 8.11: An illustration of the fact that the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean (panel a), but the sample standard deviation is a biased estimator of the population standard deviation (panel b).

Unbiasedness is a desirable characteristic for an estimator, but there are other things that matter besides bias. However, it&rsquo;s beyond the scope of this book to discuss this in any detail.

Here&rsquo;s how it works. Before tackling the standard deviation let&rsquo;s look at the variance. If you recall from Section 4.2, the sample variance is defined to be the average of the squared deviations from the sample mean. That is:</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><img src="images/image206.png"></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">The sample variance s 2 is a biased estimator of the population variance &sigma; 2 . But as it turns out, we only need to make a tiny tweak to transform this into an unbiased estimator. All we have to do is divide by N &acute;1 rather than by N. If we do that, we obtain the following formula:</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><img src="images/image207.png"></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">This is an unbiased estimator of the population variance &sigma;. Moreover, this finally answers the question we raised in Section 4.2. Why did jamovi give us slightly different answers for variance? It&rsquo;s because jamovi calculates &circ;&sigma; 2 not s 2 , that&rsquo;s why. A similar story applies for the standard deviation. If we divide by N &acute; 1 rather than N our estimate of the population standard deviation becomes: </span></p><p class="c43 c42"><img src="images/image60.png"></p><p class="c25"><span>and when we use jamovi&rsquo;s built in standard deviation function, what it&rsquo;s doing is calculating &sigma;&circ;, not s</span><img src="images/image35.png"></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image35.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c34">Okay, I&rsquo;m hiding something else here. In a bizarre and counter-intuitive twist, since &circ;&sigma; 2 is an unbiased estimator of &sigma; 2 , you&rsquo;d assume that taking the square root would be fine and &circ;&sigma; would be an unbiased estimator of &sigma;. Right? Weirdly, it&rsquo;s not. There&rsquo;s actually a subtle, tiny bias in &circ;&sigma;. This is just bizarre: &circ;&sigma; 2 is an unbiased estimate of the population variance &sigma; 2 , but when you take the square root, it turns out that &circ;&sigma; is a biased estimator of the population standard deviation &sigma;. Weird, weird, weird, right? So, why is &circ;&sigma; biased? The technical answer is &ldquo;because non-linear transformations (e.g., the square root) don&rsquo;t commute with expectation&rdquo;, but that just sounds like gibberish to everyone who hasn&rsquo;t taken a course in mathematical statistics. Fortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t matter for practical purposes. The bias is small, and in real life everyone uses &circ;&sigma; and it works just fine. Sometimes mathematics is just annoying. </span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c1 c34"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>One final point. In practice, a lot of people tend to refer to </span><img src="images/image59.png"><span>&nbsp;(i.e., the formula where we divide by </span><img src="images/image54.png"><span>) as the sample standard deviation. Technically, this is incorrect. The sample standard deviation should be equal to s (i.e., the formula where we divide by </span><img src="images/image56.png"><span>). These aren&rsquo;t the same thing, either conceptually or numerically. One is a property of the sample, the other is an estimated characteristic of the population. However, in almost every real life application what we actually care about is the estimate of the population parameter, and so people always report </span><img src="images/image59.png"><span>rather than s. This is the right number to report, of course. It&rsquo;s just that people tend to get a little bit imprecise about terminology when they write it up, because &ldquo;sample standard deviation&rdquo; is shorter than &ldquo;estimated population standard deviation&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s no big deal, and in practice I do the same thing everyone else does. Nevertheless, I think it&rsquo;s important to keep the two concepts separate. It&rsquo;s never a good idea to confuse &ldquo;known properties of your sample&rdquo; with &ldquo;guesses about the population from which it came&rdquo;. The moment you start thinking that s and </span><img src="images/image59.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;are the same thing, you start doing exactly that.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51

c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Up to this point in this chapter, I&rsquo;ve outlined the basics of sampling theory which statisticians rely on to make guesses about population parameters on the basis of a sample of data. As this discussion illustrates, one of the reasons we need all this sampling theory is that every data set leaves us with a some of uncertainty, so our estimates are never going to be perfectly accurate. The thing that has been missing from this discussion is an attempt to quantify the amount of uncertainty that attaches to our estimate. It&rsquo;s not enough to be able guess that, say, the mean IQ of undergraduate psychology students is 115 (yes, I just made that number up). We also want to be able to say something that expresses the degree of certainty that we have in our guess. For example, it would be nice to be able to say that there is a 95% chance that the true mean lies between 109 and 121. The name for this is a </span><span class="c61">confidence interval</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;for the mean.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Armed with an understanding of sampling distributions, constructing a confidence interval for the mean is actually pretty easy. Here&rsquo;s how it works. Suppose the true population mean is &micro; and the standard deviation is &sigma;. I&rsquo;ve just finished running my study that has N participants, and the mean IQ among those participants is X&macr;. We know from our discussion of the central limit theorem (Section 8.3.3) that the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal. We also know from our discussion of the normal distribution Section 7.5 that there is a 95% chance that a normally-distributed quantity will fall within about two standard deviations of the true mean. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">To be more precise, the more correct answer is that there is a 95% chance that a normallydistributed quantity will fall within 1.96 standard deviations of the true mean. Next, recall that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is referred to as the standard error, and the standard error of the mean is written as SEM. When we put all these pieces together, we learn that there is a 95% probability that the sample mean X&macr; that we have actually observed lies within 1.96 standard errors of the population mean.</span></p><p class="c25"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 687.00px; height: 358.03px;"><img alt="" src="images/image264.png" style="width: 687.00px; height: 358.03px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">Mathematically, we write this as:</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><img src="images/image209.png"></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">where the SEM is equal to &sigma;{ ? N and we can be 95% confident that this is true. However, that&rsquo;s not answering the question that we&rsquo;re actually interested in. The equation above tells us what we should expect about the sample mean given that we know what the population parameters are. What we want is to have this work the other way around. We want to know what we should believe about the population parameters, given that we have observed a particular sample. However, it&rsquo;s not too difficult to do this. Using a little high school algebra, a sneaky way to rewrite our equation is like this:</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><img src="images/image210.png"></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">What this is telling &nbsp;is that the range of values has a 95% probability of containing the population mean &micro;. We refer to this range as a 95% confidence interval, denoted CI95. In short, as long as N is sufficiently large (large enough for us to believe that the sampling distribution of the mean is normal), then we can write this as our formula for the 95% confidence interval:</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><img src="images/image211.png"></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c1 c28">Of course, there&rsquo;s nothing special about the number 1.96. It just happens to be the multiplier you need to use if you want a 95% confidence interval. If I&rsquo;d wanted a 70% confidence interval, I would have used 1.04 as the magic number rather than 1.96.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c1 c28"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">8.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimating the population mean</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">As usual, I lied. The formula that I&rsquo;ve given above for the 95% confidence interval is approximately correct, but I glossed over an important detail in the discussion. Notice my formula requires you to use the standard error of the mean, SEM, which in turn requires you to use the true population standard deviation &sigma;. Yet, in Section 8.4 I stressed the fact that we don&rsquo;t actually know the true population parameters. Because we don&rsquo;t know the true value of &sigma; we have to use an estimate of the population standard deviation &circ;&sigma; instead. This is pretty straightforward to do, but this has the consequence that we need to use the percentiles of the t-distribution rather than the normal distribution to calculate our magic number, and the answer depends on the sample size. When N is very large, we get pretty much the same value using the t-distribution or the normal distribution: 1.96. But when N is small we get a much bigger number when we use the t distribution: 2.26. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">There&rsquo;s nothing too mysterious about what&rsquo;s happening here. Bigger values mean that the confidence interval is wider, indicating that we&rsquo;re more uncertain about what the true value of &micro; actually is. When we use the t distribution instead of the normal distribution we get bigger numbers, indicating that we have more uncertainty. And why do we have that extra uncertainty? Well, because our estimate of the population standard deviation &circ;&sigma; might be wrong! If it&rsquo;s wrong, it implies that we&rsquo;re a bit less sure about what our sampling distribution of the mean actually looks like, and this uncertainty ends up getting reflected in a wider confidence interval. </span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">8.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interpreting a confidence interval</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">The hardest thing about confidence intervals is understanding what they mean. Whenever people first encounter confidence intervals, the first instinct is almost always to say that &ldquo;there is a 95% probability that the true mean lies inside the confidence interval&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s simple and it seems to capture the common sense idea of what it means to say that I am &ldquo;95% confident&rdquo;. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not quite right. The intuitive definition relies very heavily on your own personal beliefs about the value of the population mean. I say that I am 95% confident because those are my beliefs. In everyday life that&rsquo;s perfectly okay, but if you remember back to Section 7.2, you&rsquo;ll notice that talking about personal belief and confidence is a Bayesian idea. However, confidence intervals are not Bayesian tools. Like everything else in this chapter, confidence intervals are frequentist tools, and if you are going to use frequentist methods then it&rsquo;s not appropriate to attach a Bayesian interpretation to them. If you use frequentist methods, you must adopt frequentist interpretations! Okay, so if that&rsquo;s not the right answer, what is? Remember what we said about frequentist probability. The only way we are allowed to make &ldquo;probability statements&rdquo; is to talk about a sequence of events, and to count up the frequencies of different kinds of events. From that perspective, the interpretation of a 95% confidence interval must have something to do with replication. Specifically, if we replicated the experiment over and over again and computed a 95% confidence interval for each replication, then 95% of those intervals would contain the true mean. More generally, 95% of all confidence intervals constructed using this procedure should contain the true population mean. This idea is illustrated in Figure 8.12, which shows 50 confidence intervals constructed for a &ldquo;measure 10 IQ scores&rdquo; experiment (top panel) and another 50 confidence intervals for a &ldquo;measure 25 IQ scores&rdquo; experiment (bottom panel). A bit fortuitously, across the 100 replications that I simulated, it turned out that exactly 95 of them contained the true mean. The critical difference here is that the Bayesian claim makes a probability statement about the population mean (i.e., it refers to our uncertainty about the population mean), which is not allowed under the frequentist interpretation of probability because you can&rsquo;t &ldquo;replicate&rdquo; a population! In the frequentist claim, the population mean is fixed and no probabilistic claims can be made about it. Confidence intervals, however, are repeatable so we can replicate experiments. Therefore a frequentist is allowed to talk about the probability that the confidence interval (a random variable) contains the true mean, but is not allowed to talk about the probability that the true population mean (not a repeatable event) falls within the confidence interval. I know that this seems a little pedantic, but it does matter. It matters because the difference in interpretation leads to a difference in the mathematics. There is a Bayesian alternative to confidence intervals, known as credible intervals. In most situations credible intervals are quite similar to confidence intervals, but in other cases they are drastically different. As promised, though, I&rsquo;ll talk more about the Bayesian perspective in Chapter 16. </span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 627.00px; height: 531.03px;"><img alt="" src="images/image247.png" style="width: 627.00px; height: 531.03px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 8.12: 95% confidence intervals.

In total 47 of the 50 confidence intervals do contain the true mean (i.e., 100), but the three intervals marked with asterisks do not. The lower graph (panel b) shows a similar simulation, but this time we simulate replications of an experiment that measures the IQs of 25 people.</span></p><p class="c43 c42 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">8.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calculating confidence intervals in jamovi </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">As far as I can tell, jamovi does not (yet) include a simple way to calculate confidence intervals for the mean as part of the &lsquo;Descriptives&rsquo; functionality. But the &lsquo;Descriptives&rsquo; do have a check box for the S.E. Mean, so you can use this to calculate the lower 95% confidence interval as: Mean - (1.96 * S.E. Mean) , and the upper 95% confidence interval as: Mean + (1.96 * S.E. Mean) 95% confidence intervals are the de facto standard in psychology. So, for example, if I load the IQsim.omv file, check mean and S.E mean under &lsquo;Descriptives, I can work out the confidence interval associated with the simulated mean IQ: Lower 95% CI = 99.68 - (1.96 * 0.15) = 99.39 Upper 95% CI = 99.68 + (1.96 * 0.15) = 99.98 So, in our simulated large sample data with N=10,000, the mean IQ score is 99.68 with a 95% CI from 99.39 to 99.98. Hopefully that&rsquo;s fairly clear. So, although there currently is not a straightforward way to get jamovi to calculate the confidence interval as part of the variable &lsquo;Descriptives&rsquo; options, if we wanted to we could pretty easily work it out by hand. Similarly, when it comes to plotting confidence intervals in jamovi, this is not (yet) available as part of the &lsquo;Descriptives&rsquo; options. However, when we get onto learning about specific statistical tests, for example in Chapter 13, we will see that we can plot confidence intervals as part of the data analysis. That&rsquo;s pretty cool, so we&rsquo;ll show you how to do that later on.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c65">8.6</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Summary</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">In this chapter I&rsquo;ve covered two main topics.

For most applied researchers you won&rsquo;t need much more theory than this. One big question that I haven&rsquo;t touched on in this chapter is what you do when you don&rsquo;t have a simple random sample. There is a lot of statistical theory you can draw on to handle this situation, but it&rsquo;s well beyond the scope of this book. </span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c23 c25"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><h1 class="c111 c42" id="h.j87m111np2am"><span class="c24">9.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c58 c105 c78">Hypothesis testing</span></h1><p class="c75 c42"><span class="c51 c10">The process of induction is the process of assuming the simplest law that can be made to harmonize with our experience. This process, however, has no logical foundation but only a psychological one. It is clear that there are no grounds for believing that the simplest course of events will really happen. It is an hypothesis that the sun will rise tomorrow: and this means that we do not know whether it will rise.</span></p><p class="c75 c42"><span class="c62">Ludwig Wittgenstein</span><img src="images/image2.png"></p><p class="c33"><span class="c62">In the last chapter I discussed the ideas behind estimation, which is one of the two &ldquo;big ideas&rdquo; in inferential statistics. It&rsquo;s now time to turn our attention to the other big idea, which is hypothesis testing. In its most abstract form, hypothesis testing is really a very simple idea. The researcher has some theory about the world and wants to determine whether or not the data actually support that theory. However, the details are messy and most people find the theory of hypothesis testing to be the most frustrating part of statistics. The structure of the chapter is as follows. First, I&rsquo;ll describe how hypothesis testing works in a fair amount of detail, using a simple running example to show you how a hypothesis test is &ldquo;built&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll try to avoid being too dogmatic while doing so, and focus instead on the underlying logic of the testing procedure</span><img src="images/image160.png"><span class="c1 c62">&nbsp;Afterwards, I&rsquo;ll spend a bit of time talking about the various dogmas, rules and heresies that surround the theory of hypothesis testing.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c65">9.1</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">A menagerie of hypotheses</span></p><p class="c25"><span>Eventually we all succumb to madness. For me, that day will arrive once I&rsquo;m finally promoted to full professor. Safely ensconced in my ivory tower, happily protected by tenure, I will finally be able to take leave of my senses (so to speak) and indulge in that most thoroughly unproductive line of psychological research, the search for extrasensory perception (ESP)</span><img src="images/image180.png"></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image2.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c34">The quote comes from Wittgenstein&rsquo;s (1922) text, Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus.</span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image3.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c34">A technical note. The description below differs subtly from the standard description given in a lot of introductory texts. The orthodox theory of null hypothesis testing emerged from the work of Sir Ronald Fisher and Jerzy Neyman in the early 20th century; but Fisher and Neyman actually had very different views about how it should work. The standard treatment of hypothesis testing that most texts use is a hybrid of the two approaches. The treatment here is a little more Neyman-style than the orthodox view, especially as regards the meaning of the p value.</span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image4.png"><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c34">My apologies to anyone who actually believes in this stuff, but on my reading of the literature on ESP it&rsquo;s just not reasonable to think this is real. To be fair, though, some of the studies are rigorously designed, so it&rsquo;s actually an interesting area for thinking about psychological research design. And of course it&rsquo;s a free country so you can spend your own time and effort proving me wrong if you like, but I wouldn&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a terribly practical use of your intellect. </span></p><p class="c33 c23"><span class="c1 c62"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Let&rsquo;s suppose that this glorious day has come. My first study is a simple one in which I seek to test whether clairvoyance exists. Each participant sits down at a table and is shown a card by an experimenter. The card is black on one side and white on the other. The experimenter takes the card away and places it on a table in an adjacent room. The card is placed black side up or white side up completely at random, with the randomisation occurring only after the experimenter has left the room with the participant. A second experimenter comes in and asks the participant which side of the card is now facing upwards. It&rsquo;s purely a one-shot experiment. Each person sees only one card and gives only one answer, and at no stage is the participant actually in contact with someone who knows the right answer. My data set, therefore, is very simple. I have asked the question of </span><img src="images/image56.png"><span>&nbsp;people and some number </span><img src="images/image11.png"><span>of these people have given the correct response. To make things concrete, let&rsquo;s suppose that I have tested </span><img src="images/image172.png"><span>&nbsp;people and </span><img src="images/image212.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;of these got the answer right. A surprisingly large number, sure, but is it large enough for me to feel safe in claiming I&rsquo;ve found evidence for ESP? This is the situation where hypothesis testing comes in useful. However, before we talk about how to test hypotheses, we need to be clear about what we mean by hypotheses.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">9.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research hypotheses versus statistical hypotheses</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">The first distinction that you need to keep clear in your mind is between research hypotheses and statistical hypotheses. In my ESP study my overall scientific goal is to demonstrate that clairvoyance exists. In this situation I have a clear research goal: I am hoping to discover evidence for ESP. In other situations I might actually be a lot more neutral than that, so I might say that my research goal is to determine whether or not clairvoyance exists. Regardless of how I want to portray myself, the basic point that I&rsquo;m trying to convey here is that a research hypothesis involves making a substantive, testable scientific claim. If you are a psychologist then your research hypotheses are fundamentally about psychological constructs. Any of the following would count as research hypotheses:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_t4a2lhb3iyok-0 start"><li class="c4 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">Listening to music reduces</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;your ability to pay attention to other things. This is a claim about the causal relationship between two psychologically meaningful concepts (listening to music and paying attention to things), so it&rsquo;s a perfectly reasonable research hypothesis.</span></li><li class="c4 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">Intelligence is related to personality</span><span class="c51 c52">. Like the last one, this is a relational claim about two psychological constructs (intelligence and personality), but the claim is weaker: correlational not causal.</span></li><li class="c4 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">Intelligence is speed of information processing</span><span class="c51 c52">. This hypothesis has a quite different character. It&rsquo;s not actually a relational claim at all. It&rsquo;s an ontological claim about the fundamental character of intelligence (and I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s wrong). It&rsquo;s worth expanding on this one actually. It&rsquo;s usually easier to think about how to construct experiments to test research hypotheses of the form &ldquo;does X affect Y?&rdquo; than it is to address claims like &ldquo;what is X?&rdquo; And in practice what usually happens is that you find ways of testing relational claims that follow from your ontological ones. For instance, if I believe that intelligence is speed of information processing in the brain, my experiments will often involve looking for relationships between measures of intelligence and measures of speed. As a consequence most everyday research questions do tend to be relational in nature, but they&rsquo;re almost always motivated by deeper ontological questions about the state of nature.</span></li></ul><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Notice that in practice, my research hypotheses could overlap a lot. My ultimate goal in the ESP experiment might be to test an ontological claim like &ldquo;ESP exists&rdquo;, but I might operationally restrict myself to a narrower hypothesis like &ldquo;Some people can &lsquo;see&rsquo; objects in a clairvoyant fashion&rdquo;. That said, there are some things that really don&rsquo;t count as proper research hypotheses in any meaningful sense:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_j3fpdlsod9oo-0 start"><li class="c4 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">Love is a battlefield</span><span class="c1 c0">. This is too vague to be testable. Whilst it&rsquo;s okay for a research hypothesis to have a degree of vagueness to it, it has to be possible to operationalise your theoretical ideas. Maybe I&rsquo;m just not creative enough to see it, but I can&rsquo;t see how this can be converted into any concrete research design. If that&rsquo;s true then this isn&rsquo;t a scientific research hypothesis, it&rsquo;s a pop song. That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not interesting. A lot of deep questions that humans have fall into this category. Maybe one day science will be able to construct testable theories of love, or to test to see if God exists, and so on. But right now we can&rsquo;t, and I wouldn&rsquo;t bet on ever seeing a satisfying scientific approach to either. </span></li><li class="c4 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">The first rule of tautology club is the first rule of tautology club</span><span class="c51 c52">. This is not a substantive claim of any kind. It&rsquo;s true by definition. No conceivable state of nature could possibly be inconsistent with this claim. We say that this is an unfalsifiable hypothesis, and as such it is outside the domain of science. Whatever else you do in science your claims must have the possibility of being wrong. </span></li><li class="c4 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c10">More people in my experiment will say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; than &ldquo;no&rdquo;</span><span class="c51 c52">. This one fails as a research hypothesis because it&rsquo;s a claim about the data set, not about the psychology (unless of course your actual research question is whether people have some kind of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; bias!). Actually, this hypothesis is starting to sound more like a statistical hypothesis than a research hypothesis. </span></li></ul><p class="c4"><span>As you can see, research hypotheses can be somewhat messy at times and ultimately they are scientific claims. </span><span class="c61">Statistical hypotheses</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;are neither of these two things. Statistical hypotheses must be mathematically precise and they must correspond to specific claims about the characteristics of the data generating mechanism (i.e., the &ldquo;population&rdquo;). Even so, the intent is that statistical hypotheses bear a clear relationship to the substantive research hypotheses that you care about! For instance, in my ESP study my research hypothesis is that some people are able to see through walls or whatever. What I want to do is to &ldquo;map&rdquo; this onto a statement about how the data were generated. So let&rsquo;s think about what that statement would be. The quantity that I&rsquo;m interested in within the experiment is Pp&ldquo;correct&rdquo;q, the true-but-unknown probability with which the participants in my experiment answer the question correctly. Let&rsquo;s use the Greek letter &theta; (theta) to refer to this probability. Here are four different statistical hypotheses:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_4mxul57sa99i-0 start"><li class="c4 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">If ESP doesn&rsquo;t exist and if my experiment is well designed then my participants are just guessing. So I should expect them to get it right half of the time and so my statistical hypothesis is that the true probability of choosing correctly is &theta; = 0.5. </span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">Alternatively, suppose ESP does exist and participants can see the card. If that&rsquo;s true people will perform better than chance and the statistical hypothesis is that &theta; &gt; 0.5. </span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">A third possibility is that ESP does exist, but the colours are all reversed and people don&rsquo;t realise it (okay, that&rsquo;s wacky, but you never know). If that&rsquo;s how it works then you&rsquo;d expect people&rsquo;s performance to be below chance. This would correspond to a statistical hypothesis that &theta; &lt; 0.5.</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span>Finally, suppose ESP exists but I have no idea whether people are seeing the right colour or the wrong one. In that case the only claim I could make about the data would be that the probability of making the correct answer is not equal to 0.5. This corresponds to the statistical hypothesis that &theta; </span><img src="images/image86.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;0.5.</span></li></ul><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">All of these are legitimate examples of a statistical hypothesis because they are statements about a population parameter and are meaningfully related to my experiment.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">What this discussion makes clear, I hope, is that when attempting to construct a statistical hypothesis test the researcher actually has two quite distinct hypotheses to consider. First, he or she has a research hypothesis (a claim about psychology), and this then corresponds to a statistical hypothesis (a claim about the data generating population). In my ESP example these might be:</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span>Dani&rsquo;s </span><span class="c65">research</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;hypothesis: &ldquo;ESP exists&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span>Dani&rsquo;s </span><span class="c65">statistical </span><span>hypothesis: &theta; </span><img src="images/image86.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;0.5</span></p><p class="c25"><span>And a key thing to recognise is this. A statistical hypothesis test is a test of the statistical hypothesis, not the research hypothesis. If your study is badly designed then the link between your research hypothesis and your statistical hypothesis is broken. To give a silly example, suppose that my ESP study was conducted in a situation where the participant can actually see the card reflected in a window. If that happens I would be able to find very strong evidence that &theta; </span><img src="images/image86.png"><span class="c51 c52">0.5, but this would tell us nothing about whether &ldquo;ESP exists&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">9.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Null hypotheses and alternative hypotheses</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>So far, so good. I have a research hypothesis that corresponds to what I want to believe about the world, and I can map it onto a statistical hypothesis that corresponds to what I want to believe about how the data were generated. It&rsquo;s at this point that things get somewhat counter-intuitive for a lot of people. Because what I&rsquo;m about to do is invent a new statistical hypothesis (the &ldquo;null&rdquo; hypothesis,</span><img src="images/image213.png"><span>) that corresponds to the exact opposite of what I want to believe, and then focus exclusively on that almost to the neglect of the thing I&rsquo;m actually interested in (which is now called the &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; hypothesis, H1). In our ESP example, the null hypothesis is that &theta; = 0.5, since that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;d expect if ESP didn&rsquo;t exist. My hope, of course, is that ESP is totally real and so the alternative to this null hypothesis is &theta; </span><img src="images/image86.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;0.5. In essence, what we&rsquo;re doing here is dividing up the possible values of &theta; into two groups: those values that I really hope aren&rsquo;t true (the null), and those values that I&rsquo;d be happy with if they turn out to be right (the alternative). Having done so, the important thing to recognise is that the goal of a hypothesis test is not to show that the alternative hypothesis is (probably) true. The goal is to show that the null hypothesis is (probably) false. Most people find this pretty weird.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>The best way to think about it, in my experience, is to imagine that a hypothesis test is a criminal trial</span><img src="images/image5.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;, the trial of the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is the defendant, the researcher is the prosecutor, and the statistical test itself is the judge. Just like a criminal trial, there is a presumption of innocence. The null hypothesis is deemed to be true unless you, the researcher, can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it </span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image5.png"><span class="c1 c34">This analogy only works if you&rsquo;re from an adversarial legal system like UK/US/Australia. As I understand these things, the French inquisitorial system is quite different.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">is false. You are free to design your experiment however you like (within reason, obviously!) and your goal when doing so is to maximise the chance that the data will yield a conviction for the crime of being false. The catch is that the statistical test sets the rules of the trial and those rules are designed to protect the null hypothesis, specifically to ensure that if the null hypothesis is actually true the chances of a false conviction are guaranteed to be low. This is pretty important. After all, the null hypothesis doesn&rsquo;t get a lawyer, and given that the researcher is trying desperately to prove it to be false someone has to protect it.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c65">9.2</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Two types of errors</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c0">Before going into details about how a statistical test is constructed it&rsquo;s useful to understand the philosophy behind it. I hinted at it when pointing out the similarity between a null hypothesis test and a criminal trial, but I should now be explicit. Ideally, we would like to construct our test so that we never make any errors. Unfortunately, since the world is messy, this is never possible. Sometimes you&rsquo;re just really unlucky. For instance, suppose you flip a coin 10 times in a row and it comes up heads all 10 times. That feels like very strong evidence for a conclusion that the coin is biased, but of course there&rsquo;s a 1 in 1024 chance that this would happen even if the coin was totally fair. In other words, in real life we always have to accept that there&rsquo;s a chance that we made a mistake. As a consequence the goal behind statistical hypothesis testing is not to eliminate errors, but to minimise them. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>At this point, we need to be a bit more precise about what we mean by &ldquo;errors&rdquo;. First, let&rsquo;s state the obvious. It is either the case that the null hypothesis is true or that it is false, and our test will either retain the null hypothesis or reject it</span><img src="images/image194.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;So, as the table below illustrates, after we run the test and make our choice one of four things might have happened:</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><a id="t.2ab76038374b88d0a59881bb3875276fd3433a6d"></a><a id="t.27"></a><table class="c74"><tbody><tr class="c11"><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">retain H0</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">reject H0</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">H0 is true</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">correct decision</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;error (type I) </span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c1 c0">H0 is false</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">error (type II)</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;correct decision</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c1 c34"></span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c1 c34"></span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image7.png"><span class="c79">An aside regarding the language you use to talk about hypothesis testing. First, one thing you really want to avoid is the word &ldquo;prove&rdquo;. A statistical test really doesn&rsquo;t prove that a hypothesis is true or false. Proof implies certainty and, as the saying goes, statistics means never having to say you&rsquo;re certain. On that point almost everyone would agree. However, beyond that there&rsquo;s a fair amount of confusion. Some people argue that you&rsquo;re only allowed to make statements like &ldquo;rejected the null&rdquo;, &ldquo;failed to reject the null&rdquo;, or possibly &ldquo;retained the null&rdquo;. According to this line of thinking you can&rsquo;t say things like &ldquo;accept the alternative&rdquo; or &ldquo;accept the null&rdquo;. Personally I think this is too strong. In my opinion, this conflates null hypothesis testing with Karl Popper&rsquo;s falsificationist view of the scientific process. Whilst there are similarities between falsificationism and null hypothesis testing, they aren&rsquo;t equivalent. However, whilst I personally think it&rsquo;s fine to talk about accepting a hypothesis (on the proviso that &ldquo;acceptance&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t actually mean that it&rsquo;s necessarily true, especially in the case of the null hypothesis), many people will disagree. And more to the point, you should be aware that this particular weirdness exists so that you&rsquo;re not caught unawares by it when writing up your own results.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">As a consequence there are actually two different types of error here. If we reject a null hypothesis that is actually true then we have made a type I error. On the other hand, if we retain the null hypothesis when it is in fact false then we have made a type II error.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Remember how I said that statistical testing was kind of like a criminal trial? Well, I meant it. A criminal trial requires that you establish &ldquo;beyond a reasonable doubt&rdquo; that the defendant did it. All of the evidential rules are (in theory, at least) designed to ensure that there&rsquo;s (almost) no chance of wrongfully convicting an innocent defendant. The trial is designed to protect the rights of a defendant, as the English jurist William Blackstone famously said, it is &ldquo;better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.&rdquo; In other words, a criminal trial doesn&rsquo;t treat the two types of error in the same way. Punishing the innocent is deemed to be much worse than letting the guilty go free. A statistical test is pretty much the same. The single most important design principle of the test is to control the probability of a type I error, to keep it below some fixed probability. This probability, which is denoted &alpha;, is called the </span><span class="c61">significance level</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;of the test. And I&rsquo;ll say it again, because it is so central to the whole set-up, a hypothesis test is said to have significance level &alpha; if the type I error rate is no larger than &alpha;.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>So, what about the type II error rate? Well, we&rsquo;d also like to keep those under control too, and we denote this probability by &beta;. However, it&rsquo;s much more common to refer to the </span><span class="c61">power</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;of the test, that is the probability with which we reject a null hypothesis when it really is false, which is 1 - &beta;. To help keep this straight, here&rsquo;s the same table again but with the relevant numbers added:</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><a id="t.885a5b7c628958a82c34ea4f90374aa0222f0cb7"></a><a id="t.28"></a><table class="c74"><tbody><tr class="c11"><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span>retain </span><img src="images/image214.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span>reject </span><img src="images/image214.png"></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image214.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;is true</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">1 - &alpha; (probability of correct retention) </span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">&alpha; (type I error rate) </span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><img src="images/image214.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;is false</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">&beta; (type II error rate)</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c26"><span class="c51 c52">1 - &beta; (power of the test)</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">A &ldquo;powerful&rdquo; hypothesis test is one that has a small value of &beta;, while still keeping &alpha; fixed at some (small) desired level. By convention, scientists make use of three different &alpha; levels: .05, .01 and .001. Notice the asymmetry here; the tests are designed to ensure that the &alpha; level is kept small but there&rsquo;s no corresponding guarantee regarding &beta;. We&rsquo;d certainly like the type II error rate to be small and we try to design tests that keep it small, but this is typically secondary to the overwhelming need to control the type I error rate. As Blackstone might have said if he were a statistician, it is &ldquo;better to retain 10 false null hypotheses than to reject a single true one&rdquo;. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t know that I agree with this philosophy. There are situations where I think it makes sense, and situations where I think it doesn&rsquo;t, but that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. It&rsquo;s how the tests are built.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c65">9.3</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Test statistics and sampling distributions</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">At this point we need to start talking specifics about how a hypothesis test is constructed. To that end, let&rsquo;s return to the ESP example. Let&rsquo;s ignore the actual data that we obtained, for the moment, and think about the structure of the experiment. Regardless of what the actual numbers are, the form of the data is that X out of N people correctly identified the colour of the hidden card. Moreover, let&rsquo;s suppose for the moment that the null hypothesis really is true, that ESP doesn&rsquo;t exist and the true probability that anyone picks the correct colour is exactly &theta; = 0.5. What would we expect the data to look like? Well, obviously we&rsquo;d expect the proportion of people who make the correct response to be pretty close to 50%. Or, to phrase this in more mathematical terms, we&rsquo;d say that X{N is approximately 0.5. Of course, we wouldn&rsquo;t expect this fraction to be exactly 0.5. If, for example, we tested N = 100 people and X = 53 of them got the question right, we&rsquo;d probably be forced to concede that the data are quite consistent with the null hypothesis. On the other hand, if X = 99 of our participants got the question right then we&rsquo;d feel pretty confident that the null hypothesis is wrong. Similarly, if only X = 3 people got the answer right we&rsquo;d be similarly confident that the null was wrong. Let&rsquo;s be a little more technical about this. We have a quantity X that we can calculate by looking at our data. After looking at the value of X we make a decision about whether to believe that the null hypothesis is correct, or to reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative. The name for this thing that we calculate to guide our choices is a test statistic. </span></p><p class="c4"><span>Having chosen a test statistic, the next step is to state precisely which values of the test statistic would cause is to reject the null hypothesis, and which values would cause us to keep it. In order to do so we need to determine what the sampling distribution of the test statistic would be if the null hypothesis were actually true (we talked about sampling distributions earlier in Section </span><span class="c7">8.3.1</span><span class="c51 c52">). Why do we need this? Because this distribution tells us exactly what values of X our null hypothesis would lead us to expect. And, therefore, we can use this distribution as a tool for assessing how closely the null hypothesis agrees with our data.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>How do we actually determine the sampling distribution of the test statistic? For a lot of hypothesis tests this step is actually quite complicated, and later on in the book you&rsquo;ll see me being slightly evasive about it for some of the tests (some of them I don&rsquo;t even understand myself). However, sometimes it&rsquo;s very easy. And, fortunately for us, our ESP example provides us with one of the easiest cases. Our population parameter &theta; is just the overall probability that people respond correctly when asked the question, and our test statistic X is the count of the number of people who did so out of a sample size of N. We&rsquo;ve seen a distribution like this before, in Section </span><span class="c7">7.4</span><span class="c51 c52">, and that&rsquo;s exactly what the binomial distribution describes! So, to use the notation and terminology that I introduced in that section, we would say that the null hypothesis predicts that X is binomially distributed, which is written</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><img src="images/image215.png"></p><p class="c4"><span>Since the null hypothesis states that &theta; = 0.5 and our experiment has N = 100 people, we have the sampling distribution we need. This sampling distribution is plotted in Figure </span><span class="c7">9.1</span><span class="c51 c52">. No surprises really, the null hypothesis says that X = 50 is the most likely outcome, and it says that we&rsquo;re almost certain to see somewhere between 40 and 60 correct responses.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c65">9.4</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Making decisions</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Okay, we&rsquo;re very close to being finished. We&rsquo;ve constructed a test statistic (</span><img src="images/image11.png"><span class="c51 c52">) and we chose this test statistic in such a way that we&rsquo;re pretty confident that if X is close to N{2 then we should retain the null, and if not we should reject it. The question that remains is this. Exactly which values of the test statistic should we associate with the null hypothesis, and exactly which values go with the alternative hypothesis? In my ESP study, for example, I&rsquo;ve observed a value of X = 62. What decision should I make? Should I choose to believe the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis?</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">9.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Null hypotheses and alternative hypotheses</span></p><p class="c4"><span>To answer this question we need to introduce the concept of a </span><span class="c61">critical region</span><span>&nbsp;for the test statistic X. The critical region of the test corresponds to those values of </span><img src="images/image11.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;that would lead us to reject null hypothesis (which is why the critical region is also sometimes called the rejection region). How do we find this critical region? Well, let&rsquo;s consider what we know:</span></p><ul class="c14 lst-kix_hgzenn8m7ck1-0 start"><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><img src="images/image11.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;should be very big or very small in order to reject the null hypothesis.</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span>If the null hypothesis is true, the sampling distribution of </span><img src="images/image11.png"><span>&nbsp;is </span><img src="images/image216.png"><span class="c51 c52">.</span></li><li class="c25 c22 li-bullet-0"><span class="c51 c52">If &alpha; = .05, the critical region must cover 5% of this sampling distribution.</span></li></ul><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">It&rsquo;s important to make sure you understand this last point. The critical region corresponds to those values of X for which we would reject the null hypothesis, and the sampling distribution in question describes the probability that we would obtain a particular value of X if the null hypothesis were actually true. Now, let&rsquo;s suppose that we chose a critical region that covers 20% of the sampling distribution, and suppose that the null hypothesis is actually true. What would be the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null? The answer is of course 20%. And, therefore, we would have built a test that had an &alpha; level of 0.2. If we want &alpha; = .05, the critical region is only allowed to cover 5% of the sampling distribution of our test statistic.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>As it turns out those three things uniquely solve the problem. Our critical region consists of the most extreme values, known as the </span><span class="c61">tails</span><span>&nbsp;of the distribution. This is illustrated in Figure 9.2.

The concept of statistical significance is actually a very simple one, but has a very unfortunate name. If the data allow us to reject the null hypothesis, we say that &ldquo;the result is statistically significant&rdquo;, which is often shortened to &ldquo;the result is significant&rdquo;. This terminology is rather old and dates back to a time when &ldquo;significant&rdquo; just meant something like &ldquo;indicated&rdquo;, rather than its modern meaning which is much closer to &ldquo;important&rdquo;. As a result, a lot of modern readers get very confused when they start learning statistics because they think that a &ldquo;significant result&rdquo; must be an important one. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that at all. All that &ldquo;statistically significant&rdquo; means is that the data allowed us to reject a null hypothesis. Whether or not the result is actually important in the real world is a very different question, and depends on all sorts of other things.</span></p><p class="c4 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">9.4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between one sided and two sided tests</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">There&rsquo;s one more thing I want to point out about the hypothesis test that I&rsquo;ve just constructed.

It&rsquo;s called this because the alternative hypothesis covers the area on both &ldquo;sides&rdquo; of the null hypothesis, and as a consequence the critical region of the test covers both tails of the sampling distribution (2.5% on either side if &alpha; = .05), as illustrated earlier in Figure </span><span class="c7">9.2</span><span class="c1 c0">.

Nevertheless, I&rsquo;ve actually omitted the most important number of all, </span><span class="c61">the p value</span><span class="c51 c52">. It is to this topic that we now turn. There are two somewhat different ways of interpreting a p value, one proposed by Sir Ronald Fisher and the other by Jerzy Neyman. Both versions are legitimate, though they reflect very different ways of thinking about hypothesis tests. Most introductory textbooks tend to give Fisher&rsquo;s version only, but I think that&rsquo;s a bit of a shame. To my mind, Neyman&rsquo;s version is cleaner and actually better reflects the logic of the null hypothesis test. You might disagree though, so I&rsquo;ve included both. I&rsquo;ll start with Neyman&rsquo;s version. </span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">9.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A softer view of decision making</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">One problem with the hypothesis testing procedure that I&rsquo;ve described is that it makes no distinction at all between a result that is &ldquo;barely significant&rdquo; and those that are &ldquo;highly significant&rdquo;. For instance, in my ESP study the data I obtained only just fell inside the critical region, so I did get a significant effect but it was a pretty near thing. In contrast, suppose that I&rsquo;d run a study in which X = 97 out of my N = 100 participants got the answer right. This would obviously be significant too but my a much larger margin, such that there&rsquo;s really no ambiguity about this at all. The procedure that I have already described makes no distinction between the two. If I adopt the standard convention of allowing &alpha; =.05 as my acceptable Type I error rate, then both of these are significant results.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">This is where the p value comes in handy.

For &alpha; levels of .02 and below we always end up retaining the null hypothesis. Therefore, somewhere between .02 and .03 there must be a smallest value of &alpha; that would allow us to reject the null hypothesis for this data. This is the p value. As it turns out the ESP data has p = .021. In short,</span></p><p class="c25 c40"><img src="images/image219.png"><span class="c1 c34">&nbsp;is defined to be the smallest Type I error rate (&alpha;) that you have to be willing to tolerate if you want to reject the null hypothesis</span></p><p class="c25"><span>If it turns out that </span><img src="images/image219.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;describes an error rate that you find intolerable, then you must retain the null.

And as a consequence it has the effect of &ldquo;softening&rdquo; our decision process. For those tests in which </span><img src="images/image220.png"><span>&nbsp;you would have rejected the null hypothesis, whereas for those tests in which p &#261; &alpha; you would have retained the null. In my ESP study I obtained X = 62 and as a consequence I&rsquo;ve ended up with </span><img src="images/image219.png"><span>&nbsp;= .021. So the error rate I have to tolerate is 2.1%. In contrast, suppose my experiment had yielded X = 97. What happens to my p value now? This time it&rsquo;s shrunk to </span><img src="images/image221.png"><span>, which is a tiny, tiny</span><img src="images/image19.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Type I error rate. For this second case I would be able to reject the null hypothesis with a lot more confidence, because I only have to be &ldquo;willing&rdquo; to tolerate a type I error rate of about 1 in 10 trillion trillion in order to justify my decision to reject. </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">9.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The probability of extreme data</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">The second definition of the p-value comes from Sir Ronald Fisher, and it&rsquo;s actually this one that you tend to see in most introductory statistics textbooks. Notice how, when I constructed the critical region, it corresponded to the tails (i.e., extreme values) of the sampling distribution? That&rsquo;s not a coincidence, almost all &ldquo;good&rdquo; tests have this characteristic (good in the sense of minimising our type II error rate, &beta;). The reason for that is that a good critical region almost always corresponds to those values of the test statistic that are least likely to be observed if the null hypothesis is true. If this rule is true, then we can define the p-value as the probability that we would have observed a test statistic that is at least as extreme as the one we actually did get. In other words, if the data are extremely implausible according to the null hypothesis, then the null hypothesis is probably wrong.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">9.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common mistake</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Okay, so you can see that there are two rather different but legitimate ways to interpret the p value, one based on Neyman&rsquo;s approach to hypothesis testing and the other based on Fisher&rsquo;s. Unfortunately, there is a third explanation that people sometimes give, especially when they&rsquo;re first learning statistics, and it is absolutely and completely wrong. This mistaken approach is to refer to the p value as &ldquo;the probability that the null hypothesis is true&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s an intuitively appealing way to think, but it&rsquo;s wrong in two key respects. First, null hypothesis testing is a frequentist tool and the frequentist approach to probability does not allow you to assign probabilities to the null hypothesis. According to this view of probability, the null hypothesis is either true or it is not, it cannot have a &ldquo;5% chance&rdquo; of being true. Second, even within the Bayesian approach, which does let you assign probabilities to hypotheses, the p value would not correspond to the probability that the null is true. This interpretation is entirely inconsistent with the mathematics of how the p value is calculated. Put bluntly, despite the intuitive appeal of thinking this way, there is no justification for interpreting a p value this way. Never do it. </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c65">9.6</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c51 c58">Reporting the results of a hypothesis test </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">When writing up the results of a hypothesis test there&rsquo;s usually several pieces of information that you need to report, but it varies a fair bit from test to test. Throughout the rest of the book I&rsquo;ll spend a little time talking about how to report the results of different tests (see Section 10.1.9 for a particularly detailed example), so that you can get a feel for how it&rsquo;s usually done. However, regardless of what test you&rsquo;re doing, the one thing that you always have to do is say something about the p value and whether or not the outcome was significant.</span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image19.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;That&rsquo;s p &ldquo; .000000000000000000000000136 for folks that don&rsquo;t like scientific notation!</span></p><p class="c25"><span>The fact that you have to do this is unsurprising, it&rsquo;s the whole point of doing the test. What might be surprising is the fact that there is some contention over exactly how you&rsquo;re supposed to do it. Leaving aside those people who completely disagree with the entire framework underpinning null hypothesis testing, there&rsquo;s a certain amount of tension that exists regarding whether or not to report the exact p value that you obtained, or if you should state only that p </span><img src="images/image78.png"><span>&nbsp;&alpha; for a significance level that you chose in advance (e.g., p </span><img src="images/image78.png"><span class="c51 c52">.05).</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">9.6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue</span></p><p class="c4"><span>To see why this is an issue, the key thing to recognise is that p values are terribly convenient. In practice, the fact that we can compute a p value means that we don&rsquo;t actually have to specify any &alpha; level at all in order to run the test. Instead, what you can do is calculate your p value and interpret it directly. If you get p = .062, then it means that you&rsquo;d have to be willing to tolerate a Type I error rate of 6.2% to justify rejecting the null. If you personally find 6.2% intolerable then you retain the null. Therefore, the argument goes, why don&rsquo;t we just report the actual p value and let the reader make up their own minds about what an acceptable Type I error rate is? This approach has the big advantage of &ldquo;softening&rdquo; the decision making process. In fact, if you accept the Neyman definition of the p value, that&rsquo;s the whole point of the p value. We no longer have a fixed significance level of &alpha; = .05 as a bright line separating &ldquo;accept&rdquo; from &ldquo;reject&rdquo; decisions, and this removes the rather pathological problem of being forced to treat </span><img src="images/image219.png"><span>= .051 in a fundamentally different way to </span><img src="images/image219.png"><span class="c51 c52">= .049.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">This flexibility is both the advantage and the disadvantage to the p value. The reason why a lot of people don&rsquo;t like the idea of reporting an exact p value is that it gives the researcher a bit too much freedom. In particular, it lets you change your mind about what error tolerance you&rsquo;re willing to put up with after you look at the data. For instance, consider my ESP experiment. Suppose I ran my test and ended up with a p value of .09. Should I accept or reject? Now, to be honest, I haven&rsquo;t yet bothered to think about what level of Type I error I&rsquo;m &ldquo;really&rdquo; willing to accept. I don&rsquo;t have an opinion on that topic. But I do have an opinion about whether or not ESP exists, and I definitely have an opinion about whether my research should be published in a reputable scientific journal. And amazingly, now that I&rsquo;ve looked at the data I&rsquo;m starting to think that a 9% error rate isn&rsquo;t so bad, especially when compared to how annoying it would be to have to admit to the world that my experiment has failed. So, to avoid looking like I just made it up after the fact, I now say that my &alpha; is .1, with the argument that a 10% type I error rate isn&rsquo;t too bad and at that level my test is significant! I win.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">In other words, the worry here is that I might have the best of intentions, and be the most honest of people, but the temptation to just &ldquo;shade&rdquo; things a little bit here and there is really, really strong. As anyone who has ever run an experiment can attest, it&rsquo;s a long and difficult process and you often get very attached to your hypotheses. It&rsquo;s hard to let go and admit the experiment didn&rsquo;t find what you wanted it to find. And that&rsquo;s the danger here. If we use the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; p-value, people will start interpreting the data in terms of what they want to believe, not what the data are actually saying and, if we allow that, why are we even bothering to do science at all? Why not let everyone believe whatever they like about anything, regardless of what the facts are? Okay, that&rsquo;s a bit extreme, but that&rsquo;s where the worry comes from. According to this view, you really must specify your &alpha; value in advance and then only report whether the test was significant or not.

It&rsquo;s also worth noting that some people will write n.s. (not significant) rather than p </span><img src="images/image6.png"><span class="c51 c52">.05.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">9.6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two more solutions</span></p><p class="c4"><span>In practice, it&rsquo;s pretty rare for a researcher to specify a single &alpha; level ahead of time. Instead, the convention is that scientists rely on three standard significance levels: .05, .01 and .001. When reporting your results, you indicate which (if any) of these significance levels allow you to reject the null hypothesis. This is summarised in Table </span><span class="c7">9.1</span><span>. This allows us to soften the decision rule a little bit, since </span><img src="images/image229.png"><span>.01 implies that the data meet a stronger evidential standard than </span><img src="images/image229.png"><span class="c51 c52">.05 would. Nevertheless, since these levels are fixed in advance by convention, it does prevent people choosing their &alpha; level after looking at the data.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Nevertheless, quite a lot of people still prefer to report exact p values. To many people, the advantage of allowing the reader to make up their own mind about how to interpret </span><img src="images/image230.png"><span>.06 outweighs any disadvantages. In practice, however, even among those researchers who prefer exact p values it is quite common to just write p &#259; .001 instead of reporting an exact value for small p. This is in part because a lot of software doesn&rsquo;t actually print out the p value when it&rsquo;s that small (e.g., SPSS just writes p = .000 whenever p </span><img src="images/image78.png"><span>.001), and in part because a very small p value can be kind of misleading. The human mind sees a number like .0000000001 and it&rsquo;s hard to suppress the gut feeling that the evidence in favour of the alternative hypothesis is a near certainty. In practice however, this is usually wrong. Life is a big, messy, complicated thing, and every statistical test ever invented relies on simplifications, approximations and assumptions. As a consequence, it&rsquo;s probably not reasonable to walk away from any statistical analysis with a feeling of confidence stronger than p </span><img src="images/image78.png"><span>&nbsp;.001 implies. In other words, p </span><img src="images/image78.png"><span class="c51 c52">.001 is really code for &ldquo;as far as this test is concerned, the evidence is overwhelming.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span>In light of all this, you might be wondering exactly what you should do. There&rsquo;s a fair bit of contradictory advice on the topic, with some people arguing that you should report the exact p value, and other people arguing that you should use the tiered approach illustrated in Table </span><span class="c7">9.1</span><span class="c51 c52">. As a result, the best advice I can give is to suggest that you look at papers/reports written in your field and see what the convention seems to be.

However, this test already exists. It&rsquo;s called the binomial test, and it&rsquo;s implemented by jamovi as one of the statistical analyses available when you hit the &lsquo;Frequencies&rsquo; button.

When we fix &alpha; = .05 we are attempting to ensure that only 5% of true null hypotheses are incorrectly rejected. However, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that we don&rsquo;t care about Type II errors. In fact, from the researcher&rsquo;s perspective, the error of failing to reject the null when it is actually false is an extremely annoying one. With that in mind, a secondary goal of hypothesis testing is to try to minimise &beta;, the Type II error rate, although we don&rsquo;t usually talk in terms of minimising Type II errors. Instead, we talk about maximising the power of the test. Since power is defined as 1 - &beta;, this is the same thing. </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">9.8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power function</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 521.00px; height: 425.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image317.png" style="width: 521.00px; height: 425.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 9.5: Sampling distribution under the alternative hypothesis for a population parameter value of &theta; &ldquo; 0.55. A reasonable proportion of the distribution lies in the rejection region.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Let&rsquo;s take a moment to think about what a Type II error actually is. A Type II error occurs when the alternative hypothesis is true, but we are nevertheless unable to reject the null hypothesis. Ideally, we&rsquo;d be able to calculate a single number &beta; that tells us the Type II error rate, in the same way that we can set &alpha; = .05 for the Type I error rate. Unfortunately, this is a lot trickier to do. To see this, notice that in my ESP study the alternative hypothesis actually corresponds to lots of possible values of &theta;. In fact, the alternative hypothesis corresponds to every value of &theta; except 0.5. Let&rsquo;s suppose that the true probability of someone choosing the correct response is 55% (i.e., &theta; = .55). If so, then the true sampling distribution for X is not the same one that the null hypothesis predicts, as the most likely value for X is now 55 out of 100. Not only that, the whole sampling distribution has now shifted, as shown in Figure 9.5. The critical regions, of course, do not change. By definition the critical regions are based on what the null hypothesis predicts. What we&rsquo;re seeing in this figure is the fact that when the null hypothesis is wrong, a much larger proportion of the sampling distribution distribution falls in the critical region. And of course that&rsquo;s what should happen. The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis is larger when the null hypothesis is actually false! However &theta; = .55 is not the only possibility consistent with the alternative hypothesis. Let&rsquo;s instead suppose that the true value of &theta; is actually 0.7. What happens to the sampling distribution when this occurs? The answer, shown in Figure 9.6, is that almost the entirety of the sampling distribution has now moved into the critical region. Therefore, if &theta; = 0.7, the probability of us correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e., the power of the test) is much larger than if &theta; = 0.55. In short, while &theta; = .55 and &theta; = .70 are both part of the alternative hypothesis, the Type II error rate is different.</span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 507.00px; height: 433.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image253.png" style="width: 507.00px; height: 433.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 9.6: Sampling distribution under the alternative hypothesis for a population parameter value of &theta; = 0.70.

To illustrate this, I&rsquo;ve calculated the expected probability of rejecting the null hypothesis for all values of &theta;, and plotted it in Figure </span><span class="c7">9.7</span><span>. This plot describes what is usually called the </span><span class="c61">power function</span><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;of the test. It&rsquo;s a nice summary of how good the test is, because it actually tells you the power (1- &beta;) for all possible values of &theta;. As you can see, when the true value of &theta; is very close to 0.5, the power of the test drops very sharply, but when it is further away, the power is large. </span></p><p class="c43 c42"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 604.00px; height: 436.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image265.png" style="width: 604.00px; height: 436.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Figure 9.7: The probability that we will reject the null hypothesis, plotted as a function of the true value of &theta;.

If the true state of the world is very different from what the null hypothesis predicts then your power will be very high, but if the true state of the world is similar to the null (but not identical) then the power of the test is going to be very low. Therefore, it&rsquo;s useful to be able to have some way of quantifying how &ldquo;similar&rdquo; the true state of the world is to the null hypothesis. A statistic that does this is called a measure of </span><span class="c61">effect size</span><span>&nbsp;(e.g., (</span><span class="c7">Cohen 2013); (Ellis 2010)</span><span>). Effect size is defined slightly differently in different contexts (and so this section just talks in general terms) but the qualitative idea that it tries to capture is always the same. How big is the difference between the true population parameters and the parameter values that are assumed by the null hypothesis? In our ESP example, if we let </span><img src="images/image231.png"><span>0.5 denote the value assumed by the null hypothesis and let &theta; denote the true value, then a simple measure of effect size could be something like the difference between the true value and null (i.e., </span><img src="images/image232.png"><span>), or possibly just the magnitude of this difference, abs</span><img src="images/image233.png"><span class="c51 c52">.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><a id="t.2b563ce6efbb139aa5dd5a438d406349acc55fa9"></a><a id="t.31"></a><table class="c74"><tbody><tr class="c11"><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c35 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c35"><span class="c51 c52">big effect size</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c35"><span class="c51 c52">small effect size</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c35"><span class="c51 c52">significant result</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c35"><span class="c1 c0">difference is real, and</span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c51 c52">of practical importance</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c35"><span class="c51 c52">difference is real, but</span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c51 c52">might not be interesting </span></p></td></tr><tr class="c11"><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c35"><span class="c51 c52">non-significant result</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c35"><span class="c51 c52">no effect observed</span></p></td><td class="c36" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c35"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;no effect observed </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c4 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Table 9.2: A crude guide to understanding the relationship between statistical significance and effect sizes. Basically, if you don&rsquo;t have a significant result then the effect size is pretty meaningless because you don&rsquo;t have any evidence that it&rsquo;s even real. On the other hand, if you do have a significant effect but your effect size is small then there&rsquo;s a pretty good chance that your result (although real) isn&rsquo;t all that interesting. However, this guide is very crude. It depends a lot on what exactly you&rsquo;re studying. Small effects can be of massive practical importance in some situations. So don&rsquo;t take this table too seriously. It&rsquo;s a rough guide at best.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Why calculate effect size? Let&rsquo;s assume that you&rsquo;ve run your experiment, collected the data, and gotten a significant effect when you ran your hypothesis test. Isn&rsquo;t it enough just to say that you&rsquo;ve gotten a significant effect? Surely that&rsquo;s the point of hypothesis testing? Well, sort of. Yes, the point of doing a hypothesis test is to try to demonstrate that the null hypothesis is wrong, but that&rsquo;s hardly the only thing we&rsquo;re interested in. If the null hypothesis claimed that &theta; = .5 and we show that it&rsquo;s wrong, we&rsquo;ve only really told half of the story. Rejecting the null hypothesis implies that we believe that &theta;</span><img src="images/image86.png"><span>&nbsp;.5, but there&rsquo;s a big difference between &theta; = .51 and &theta; =.8. If we find that &theta;= .8, then not only have we found that the null hypothesis is wrong, it appears to be very wrong. On the other hand, suppose we&rsquo;ve successfully rejected the null hypothesis, but it looks like the true value of &theta; is only .51 (this would only be possible with a very large study). Sure, the null hypothesis is wrong but it&rsquo;s not at all clear that we actually care because the effect size is so small. In the context of my ESP study we might still care since any demonstration of real psychic powers would actually be pretty cool</span><img src="images/image122.png"><span class="c51 c52">, but in other contexts a 1% difference usually isn&rsquo;t very interesting, even if it is a real difference. For instance, suppose we&rsquo;re looking at differences in high school exam scores between males and females and it turns out that the female scores are 1% higher on average than the males. If I&rsquo;ve got data from thousands of students then this difference will almost certainly be statistically significant, but regardless of how small the p value is it&rsquo;s just not very interesting. You&rsquo;d hardly want to go around proclaiming a crisis in boys education on the basis of such a tiny difference would you? It&rsquo;s for this reason that it is becoming more standard (slowly, but surely) to report some kind of standard measure of effect size along with the the results of the </span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">9.8.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing the power of your study</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Not surprisingly, scientists are fairly obsessed with maximising the power of their experiments. We want our experiments to work and so we want to maximise the chance of rejecting the null hypothesis if it is false (and of course we usually want to believe that it is false!). As we&rsquo;ve seen, one factor that influences power is the effect size. So the first thing you can do to increase your power is to increase the effect size. In practice, what this means is that you want to design your study in such a way that the effect size gets magnified. For instance, in my ESP study I might believe that psychic powers work best in a quiet, darkened room with fewer distractions to cloud the mind. Therefore I would try to conduct my experiments in just such an environment. If I can strengthen people&rsquo;s ESP abilities somehow then the true value of &theta; will go up</span><img src="images/image234.png"><span>&nbsp;and therefore my effect size will be larger. In short, clever experimental design is one way to boost power, because it can alter the effect size. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s often the case that even with the best of experimental designs you may have only a small effect. Perhaps, for example, ESP really does exist but even under the best of conditions it&rsquo;s very very weak. Under those circumstances your best bet for increasing power is to increase the sample size. In general, the more observations that you have available, the more likely it is that you can discriminate between two hypotheses. If I ran my ESP experiment with 10 participants and 7 of them correctly guessed the colour of the hidden card you wouldn&rsquo;t be terribly impressed. But if I ran it with 10,000 participants, and 7,000 of them got the answer right, you would be much more likely to think I had discovered something. In other words, power increases with the sample size. This is illustrated in Figure 9.8, which shows the power of the test for a true parameter of &theta; = 0.7 for all sample sizes N from 1 to 100, where I&rsquo;m assuming that the null hypothesis predicts that </span><img src="images/image231.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;0.5.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image122.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Although in practice a very small effect size is worrying because even very minor methodological flaws might be responsible for the effect, and in practice no experiment is perfect so there are always methodological issues to worry about.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">hypothesis test. The hypothesis test itself tells you whether you should believe that the effect you have observed is real (i.e., not just due to chance), whereas the effect size tells you whether or not you should care.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Because power is important, whenever you&rsquo;re contemplating running an experiment it would be pretty useful to know how much power you&rsquo;re likely to have. It&rsquo;s never possible to know for sure since you can&rsquo;t possibly know what your real effect size is. However, it&rsquo;s often (well, sometimes) possible to guess how big it should be. If so, you can guess what sample size you need! This idea is called power analysis, and if it&rsquo;s feasible to do it then it&rsquo;s very helpful. It can tell you something about whether you have enough time or money to be able to run the experiment successfully. It&rsquo;s increasingly common to see people arguing that power analysis should be a required part of experimental design, so it&rsquo;s worth knowing about. I don&rsquo;t discuss power analysis in this book, however. This is partly for a boring reason and partly for a substantive one. The boring reason is that I haven&rsquo;t had time to write about power analysis yet. The substantive one is that I&rsquo;m still a little suspicious of power analysis. Speaking as a researcher, I have very rarely found myself in a position to be able to do one. It&rsquo;s either the case that (a) my experiment is </span></p><p class="c4"><span>a bit non-standard and I don&rsquo;t know how to define effect size properly, or (b) I literally have so little idea about what the effect size will be that I wouldn&rsquo;t know how to interpret the answers. Not only that, after extensive conversations with someone who does stats consulting for a living (my wife, as it happens), I can&rsquo;t help but notice that in practice the only time anyone ever asks her for a power analysis is when she&rsquo;s helping someone write a grant application. In other words, the only time any scientist ever seems to want a power analysis in real life is when they&rsquo;re being forced to do it by bureaucratic process. It&rsquo;s not part of anyone&rsquo;s day to day work. In short, I&rsquo;ve always been of the view that whilst power is an important concept, power analysis is not as useful as people make it sound, except in the rare cases where (a) someone has figured out how to calculate power for your actual experimental design and (b) you have a pretty good idea what the effect size is likely to be</span><img src="images/image235.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Maybe other people have had better experiences than me, but I&rsquo;ve personally never been in a situation where both (a) and (b) were true. Maybe I&rsquo;ll be convinced otherwise in the future, and probably a future version of this book would include a more detailed discussion of power analysis, but for now this is about as much as I&rsquo;m comfortable saying about the topic.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image234.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Notice that the true population parameter &theta; doesn&rsquo;t necessarily correspond to an immutable fact of nature.

Understanding how NHST works is an absolute necessity because it has been the dominant approach to inferential statistics ever since it came to prominence in the early 20th century. It&rsquo;s what the vast majority of working scientists rely on for their data analysis, so even if you hate it you need to know it. However, the approach is not without problems. There are a number of quirks in the framework, historical oddities in how it came to be, theoretical disputes over whether or not the framework is right, and a lot of practical traps for the unwary. I&rsquo;m not going to go into a lot of detail on this topic, but I think it&rsquo;s worth briefly discussing a few of these issues.</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">9.9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neyman versus Fisher</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">The first thing you should be aware of is that orthodox NHST is actually a mash-up of two rather different approaches to hypothesis testing, one proposed by Sir Ronald Fisher and the other proposed by Jerzy Neyman (see Lehmann 2011, for a historical summary). The history is messy because Fisher and Neyman were real people whose opinions changed over time, and at no point did either of them offer &ldquo;the definitive statement&rdquo; of how we should interpret their work many decades later. That said, here&rsquo;s a quick summary of what I take these two approaches to be. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">First, let&rsquo;s talk about Fisher&rsquo;s approach. As far as I can tell, Fisher assumed that you only had the one hypothesis (the null) and that what you want to do is find out if the null hypothesis is inconsistent with the data. From his perspective, what you should do is check to see if the data are &ldquo;sufficiently unlikely&rdquo; according to the null. In fact, if you remember back to our earlier discussion, that&rsquo;s how Fisher defines the p-value. According to Fisher, if the null hypothesis provided a very poor account of the data then you could safely reject it. But, since you don&rsquo;t have any other hypotheses to compare it to, there&rsquo;s no way of &ldquo;accepting the alternative&rdquo; because you don&rsquo;t necessarily have an explicitly stated alternative. That&rsquo;s more or less all there is to it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">In contrast, Neyman thought that the point of hypothesis testing was as a guide to action and his approach was somewhat more formal than Fisher&rsquo;s. His view was that there are multiple things that you could do (accept the null or accept the alternative) and the point of the test was to tell you which one the data support. From this perspective, it is critical to specify your alternative hypothesis properly. If you don&rsquo;t know what the alternative hypothesis is, then you don&rsquo;t know how powerful the test is, or even which action makes sense. His framework genuinely requires a competition between different hypotheses. For Neyman, the p value didn&rsquo;t directly measure the probability of the data (or data more extreme) under the null, it was more of an abstract description about which &ldquo;possible tests&rdquo; were telling you to accept the null, and which &ldquo;possible tests&rdquo; were telling you to accept the alternative.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>As you can see, what we have today is an odd mishmash of the two. We talk about having both a null hypothesis and an alternative (Neyman), but usually</span><img src="images/image237.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;define the p value in terms of exreme data (Fisher), but we still have &alpha; values (Neyman). Some of the statistical tests have explicitly specified alternatives (Neyman) but others are quite vague about it (Fisher). And, according to some people at least, we&rsquo;re not allowed to talk about accepting the alternative (Fisher). It&rsquo;s a mess, but I hope this at least explains why it&rsquo;s a mess.</span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">9.9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bayesians versus frequentists</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Earlier on in this chapter I was quite emphatic about the fact that you cannot interpret the p value as the probability that the null hypothesis is true. NHST is fundamentally a frequentist tool (see Chapter 7) and as such it does not allow you to assign probabilities to hypotheses. The null hypothesis is either true or it is not. The Bayesian approach to statistics interprets probability as a degree of belief, so it&rsquo;s totally okay to say that there is a 10% chance that the null hypothesis is true. That&rsquo;s just a reflection of the degree of confidence that you have in this hypothesis. You aren&rsquo;t allowed to do this within the frequentist approach. Remember, if you&rsquo;re a frequentist, a probability can only be defined in terms of what happens after a large number of independent replications (i.e., a long run frequency). If this is your interpretation of probability, talking about the &ldquo;probability&rdquo; that the null hypothesis is true is complete gibberish: a null </span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image237.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;Although this book describes both Neyman&rsquo;s and Fisher&rsquo;s definition of the p value, most don&rsquo;t. Most introductory textbooks will only give you the Fisher version.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">hypothesis is either true or it is false. There&rsquo;s no way you can talk about a long run frequency for this statement. To talk about &ldquo;the probability of the null hypothesis&rdquo; is as meaningless as &ldquo;the colour of freedom&rdquo;. It doesn&rsquo;t have one! Most importantly, this isn&rsquo;t a purely ideological matter. If you decide that you are a Bayesian and that you&rsquo;re okay with making probability statements about hypotheses, you have to follow the Bayesian rules for calculating those probabilities. I&rsquo;ll talk more about this in Chapter 16, but for now what I want to point out to you is the p value is a terrible approximation to the probability that H0 is true. If what you want to know is the probability of the null, then the p value is not what you&rsquo;re looking for!</span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c51 c52">9.9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traps</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">As you can see, the theory behind hypothesis testing is a mess, and even now there are arguments in statistics about how it &ldquo;should&rdquo; work. However, disagreements among statisticians are not our real concern here. Our real concern is practical data analysis. And while the &ldquo;orthodox&rdquo; approach to null hypothesis significance testing has many drawbacks, even an unrepentant Bayesian like myself would agree that they can be useful if used responsibly. Most of the time they give sensible answers and you can use them to learn interesting things. Setting aside the various ideologies and historical confusions that we&rsquo;ve discussed, the fact remains that the biggest danger in all of statistics is thoughtlessness. I don&rsquo;t mean stupidity, I literally mean thoughtlessness. The rush to interpret a result without spending time thinking through what each test actually says about the data, and checking whether that&rsquo;s consistent with how you&rsquo;ve interpreted it. That&rsquo;s where the biggest trap lies.</span></p><p class="c4"><span>To give an example of this, consider the following example (see Gelman and Stern 2006). Suppose I&rsquo;m running my ESP study and I&rsquo;ve decided to analyse the data separately for the male participants and the female participants. Of the male participants, 33 out of 50 guessed the colour of the card correctly. This is a significant effect (p = .03). Of the female participants, 29 out of 50 guessed correctly. This is not a significant effect (p = .32). Upon observing this, it is extremely tempting for people to start wondering why there is a difference between males and females in terms of their psychic abilities. However, this is wrong. If you think about it, we haven&rsquo;t actually run a test that explicitly compares males to females. All we have done is compare males to chance (binomial test was significant) and compared females to chance (binomial test was non significant). If we want to argue that there is a real difference between the males and the females, we should probably run a test of the null hypothesis that there is no difference! We can do that using a different hypothesis test</span><img src="images/image238.png"><span class="c51 c52">&nbsp;but when we do that it turns out that we have no evidence that males and females are significantly different (p = .54). Now do you think that there&rsquo;s anything fundamentally different between the two groups? Of course not. What&rsquo;s happened here is that the data from both groups (male and female) are pretty borderline. By pure chance one of them happened to end up on the magic side of the p = .05 line, and the other one didn&rsquo;t. That doesn&rsquo;t actually imply that males and females are different. This mistake is so common that you should always be wary of it. The difference between significant and not-significant is not evidence of a real difference. If you want to say that there&rsquo;s a difference between two groups, then you have to test for that difference! </span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><hr><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><img src="images/image239.png"><span class="c51 c52">In this case, the Pearson chi-square test of independence (Chapter 10) </span></p><p class="c25 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">The example above is just that, an example. I&rsquo;ve singled it out because it&rsquo;s such a common one, but the bigger picture is that data analysis can be tricky to get right. Think about what it is you want to test, why you want to test it, and whether or not the answers that your test gives could possibly make any sense in the real world.</span></p><p class="c4 c23"><span class="c51 c52"></span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c65">9.10</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c65">Summary</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c51 c52">Null hypothesis testing is one of the most ubiquitous elements to statistical theory.
