<h1> 13. Comparing several means (one-way ANOVA) </h1>



This chapter introduces one of the most widely used tools in psychological statistics, known
as “the analysis of variance”, but usually referred to as ANOVA. The basic technique was
developed by Sir Ronald Fisher in the early 20th century and it is to him that we owe the rather
unfortunate terminology. The term ANOVA is a little misleading, in two respects. Firstly,
although the name of the technique refers to variances, ANOVA is concerned with investigating
differences in means. Secondly, there are several different things out there that are all referred
to as ANOVAs, some of which have only a very tenuous connection to one another. Later on
in the book we’ll encounter a range of different ANOVA methods that apply in quite different
situations, but for the purposes of this chapter we’ll only consider the simplest form of ANOVA,
in which we have several different groups of observations, and we’re interested in finding out
whether those groups differ in terms of some outcome variable of interest. This is the question
that is addressed by a one-way ANOVA.



The structure of this chapter is as follows: in Section 13.1 I’ll introduce a fictitious data
set that we’ll use as a running example throughout the chapter. After introducing the data,
I’ll describe the mechanics of how a one-way ANOVA actually works (Section 13.2) and then
focus on how you can run one in jamovi (Section 13.3). These two sections are the core of the
chapter. The remainder of the chapter discusses a range of important topics that inevitably
arise when running an ANOVA, namely how to calculate effect sizes (Section 13.4), post hoc
tests and corrections for multiple comparisons (Section 13.5) and the assumptions that ANOVA
relies upon (Section 13.6). We’ll also talk about how to check those assumptions and some of
the things you can do if the assumptions are violated (Sections 13.6.1 to 13.7). Then we’ll cover
repeated measures ANOVA in Sections 13.8 and 13.9. At the end of the chapter we’ll talk a
little about the relationship between ANOVA and other statistical tools (Section 13.10).





<h2> 13.1 An illustrative data set </h2>



Suppose you’ve become involved in a clinical trial in which you are testing a new antidepressant
drug called Joyzepam. In order to construct a fair test of the drug’s effectiveness, the study
involves three separate drugs to be administered. One is a placebo, and the other is an existing
antidepressant / anti-anxiety drug called Anxifree. A collection of 18 participants with moderate
to severe depression are recruited for your initial testing. Because the drugs are sometimes
administered in conjunction with psychological therapy, your study includes 9 people undergoing
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and 9 who are not. Participants are randomly assigned
(doubly blinded, of course) a treatment, such that there are 3 CBT people and 3 no-therapy
people assigned to each of the 3 drugs. A psychologist assesses the mood of each person after a
3 month run with each drug, and the overall improvement in each person’s mood is assessed on
a scale ranging from ´5 to `5. With that as the study design, let’s now load up the data file in
clinicaltrial.csv. We can see that this data set contains the three variables drug, therapy
and mood.gain.





For the purposes of this chapter, what we’re really interested in is the effect of drug on
mood.gain. The first thing to do is calculate some descriptive statistics and draw some graphs.
In Chapter <font color="blue"><b>4</b></font> we showed you how to do this, and some of the descriptive statistics we can
calculate in jamovi are shown in Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.1</b></font>.




<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 13.1: Descriptives for mood gain, and box plots by drug administered
</figcaption>
<img src="images/Figure129.PNG" alt="Figure 13.1" />
</figure>




As the plot makes clear, there is a larger improvement in mood for participants in the
Joyzepam group than for either the Anxifree group or the placebo group. The Anxifree group
shows a larger mood gain than the control group, but the difference isn’t as large. The question
that we want to answer is are these difference “real”, or are they just due to chance?




<h2> 13.2 How ANOVA works </h2>



In order to answer the question posed by our clinical trial data we’re going to run a one-way
ANOVA. I’m going to start by showing you how to do it the hard way, building the statistical
tool from the ground up and showing you how you could do it if you didn’t have access to any
of the cool built-in ANOVA functions in jamovi. And I hope you’ll read it carefully, try to do
it the long way once or twice to make sure you really understand how ANOVA works, and then
once you’ve grasped the concept never ever do it this way again.


The experimental design that I described in the previous section strongly suggests that we’re
interested in comparing the average mood change for the three different drugs. In that sense,
we’re talking about an analysis similar to the t-test (Chapter <font color="blue"><b>11</b></font>) but involving more than two
groups. If we let µP denote the population mean for the mood change induced by the placebo,
and let µA and µJ denote the corresponding means for our two drugs, Anxifree and Joyzepam,
then the (somewhat pessimistic) null hypothesis that we want to test is that all three population
means are identical. That is, neither of the two drugs is any more effective than a placebo. We
can write out this null hypothesis as:



$$H_0: it is true that \mu_P=\mu_A=\mu_J$$



As a consequence, our alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the three different treatments
is different from the others. It’s a bit tricky to write this mathematically, because (as we’ll
discuss) there are quite a few different ways in which the null hypothesis can be false. So for
now we’ll just write the alternative hypothesis like this:


$$H_1: it is <u>not</u> that \mu_P=\mu_A=\mu_J$$


This null hypothesis is a lot trickier to test than any of the ones we’ve seen previously. How shall
we do it? A sensible guess would be to “do an ANOVA”, since that’s the title of the chapter, but
it’s not particularly clear why an “analysis of variances” will help us learn anything useful about
the means. In fact, this is one of the biggest conceptual difficulties that people have when first
encountering ANOVA. To see how this works, I find it most helpful to start by talking about
variances. In fact, what I’m going to do is start by playing some mathematical games with the
formula that describes the variance. That is, we’ll start out by playing around with variances
and it will turn out that this gives us a useful tool for investigating means.




<h2> 13.2.1 Two formulas for the variance of Y </h2>



First, let’s start by introducing some notation. We’ll use G to refer to the total number of
groups. For our data set there are three drugs, so there are G “ 3 groups. Next, we’ll use N
to refer to the total sample size; there are a total of N “ 18 people in our data set. Similarly,
let’s use Nk to denote the number of people in the k-th group. In our fake clinical trial, the
sample size is Nk “ 6 for all three groups.1 Finally, we’ll use Y to denote the outcome variable.
In our case, Y refers to mood change. Specifically, we’ll use Yik to refer to the mood change
experienced by the i-th member of the k-th group. Similarly, we’ll use Y¯ to be the average
mood change, taken across all 18 people in the experiment, and Y¯
k to refer to the average mood
change experienced by the 6 people in group k.



<table width="100%" border="1" ><caption></caption>
	<tr>
		<td> 
		Now that we’ve got our notation sorted out we can start writing down formulas. To start with,
let’s recall the formula for the variance that we used in Section 4.2, way back in those kinder
days when we were just doing descriptive statistics. The sample variance of Y is defined as
follows

$$Var(Y)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^{G}\sum_{i=1}^{N_k}(Y_{ik}-\bar{Y})^2$$

This formula looks pretty much identical to the formula for the variance in Section 4.2. The
only difference is that this time around I’ve got two summations here: I’m summing over
groups (i.e., values for k) and over the people within the groups (i.e., values for i). This is
purely a cosmetic detail. If I’d instead used the notation Yp to refer to the value of the outcome
variable for person p in the sample, then I’d only have a single summation. The only reason
that we have a double summation here is that I’ve classified people into groups, and then
assigned numbers to people within groups.

		
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

A concrete example might be useful here. Let’s consider this table, in which we have a total
of N “ 5 people sorted into G “ 2 groups. Arbitrarily, let’s say that the “cool” people are group
1 and the “uncool” people are group 2. It turns out that we have three cool people (N1 “ 3)
and two uncool people (N2 “ 2)


<table width="100%" border="1" ><caption></caption>
	<tr>
		<td> name </td>
		<td>  person P </td>
		<td> group </td>
		<td> group num. k </td>
		<td>  index in group </td>
		<td>  grumpiness \( Y_{ik} \) or \( Y_p \) </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> Ann </td>
		<td> 1 </td>
		<td>  cool </td>
		<td> 1 </td>
		<td> 1 </td>
		<td> 20 </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td> Ben </td>

		<td> Egg </td>
		<td>   5 </td>
		<td> uncool </td>
		<td>  2 </td>
		<td> 2 </td>
		<td>   22 </td>
	</tr>
</table>


Notice that I’ve constructed two different labelling schemes here. We have a “person” variable
p so it would be perfectly sensible to refer to Yp as the grumpiness of the p-th person in the
sample. For instance, the table shows that Dan is the fourth so we’d say p “ 4. So, when
talking about the grumpiness Y of this “Dan” person, whoever he might be, we could refer to
his grumpiness by saying that Yp “ 91, for person p “ 4 that is. However, that’s not the only
way we could refer to Dan. As an alternative we could note that Dan belongs to the “uncool”
group (k “ 2), and is in fact the first person listed in the uncool group (i “ 1). So it’s equally
valid to refer to Dan’s grumpiness by saying that Yik “ 91, where k “ 2 and i “ 1.



<table width="100%" border="1" ><caption></caption>
	<tr>
		<td> In other words, each person p corresponds to a unique ik combination, and so the formula
that I gave above is actually identical to our original formula for the variance, which would be

$$Var(Y)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{p=1}^{N}(Y_p-\bar{Y})^2$$

In both formulas, all we’re doing is summing over all of the observations in the sample. Most
of the time we would just use the simpler Yp notation; the equation using Yp is clearly the
simpler of the two. However, when doing an ANOVA it’s important to keep track of which
participants belong in which groups, and we need to use the Yik notation to do this.

 </td>
	</tr>
</table>



<h2> 13.2.2 From variances to sums of squares </h2>


Okay, now that we’ve got a good grasp on how the variance is calculated, let’s define something 
called the total sum of squares, which is denoted SStot. This is very simple. Instead of
averaging the squared deviations, which is what we do when calculating the variance, we just
add them up.



<table width="100%" border="1" ><caption></caption>
	<tr>
		<td> So the formula for the total sum of squares is almost identical to the formula for the variance
		
		
$$SS_{tot}=\sum{k=1}{G}\sum_{i=1}^{N_k}(Y_{ik}-\bar{Y})^2$$


 </td>
	</tr>
</table>


When we talk about analysing variances in the context of ANOVA, what we’re really doing is
working with the total sums of squares rather than the actual variance. One very nice thing
about the total sum of squares is that we can break it up into two different kinds of variation.




<table width="100%" border="1" ><caption></caption>
	<tr>
		<td> First, we can talk about the within-group sum of squares, in which we look to see how
different each individual person is from their own group mean
		
$$SS_{w}=\sum{k=1}{G}\sum_{i=1}^{N_k}(Y_{ik}-\bar{Y}_k)^2$$

where Y¯
k is a group mean. In our example, Y¯
k would be the average mood change experienced
by those people given the k-th drug. So, instead of comparing individuals to the average
of all people in the experiment, we’re only comparing them to those people in the the same
group. As a consequence, you’d expect the value of SSw to be smaller than the total sum of
squares, because it’s completely ignoring any group differences, i.e., whether the drugs will
have different effects on people’s moods

 </td>
	</tr>
</table>



Next, we can define a third notion of variation which captures only the differences between
groups. We do this by looking at the differences between the group means Y¯
k and grand mean
Y¯ .

variation (panel b). On the left the arrows show the differences in the group means. On the

</figure>




<table width="100%" border="1" ><caption></caption>
	<tr>
		<td> In order to quantify the extent of this variation, what we do is calculate the between-group
sum of squares
		
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
SS_{b}& =\sum{k=1}{G}\sum_{i=1}^{N_k}(\bar{Y}_{k}-\bar{Y})^2
& = \sum_{k=1}^{G} N_k (\bar{Y}_k-\bar{Y})^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}

 </td>
	</tr>
</table>


It’s not too difficult to show that the total variation among people in the experiment SStot is
actually the sum of the differences between the groups SSb and the variation inside the groups
SSw. That is,


$$SS_w+SS_b=SS_{tot}$$

Yay.


Okay, so what have we found out? We’ve discovered that the total variability associated with
the outcome variable (SStot) can be mathematically carved up into the sum of “the variation due
to the differences in the sample means for the different groups” (SSb) plus “all the rest of the
variation” (SSw)
2
. How does that help me find out whether the groups have different population
means? Um. Wait. Hold on a second. Now that I think about it, this is exactly what we were
looking for. If the null hypothesis is true then you’d expect all the sample means to be pretty
similar to each other, right? And that would imply that you’d expect SSb to be really small, or
at least you’d expect it to be a lot smaller than “the variation associated with everything else”,
SSw. Hmm. I detect a hypothesis test coming on.





<h2> 13.2.3 From sums of squares to the F-test</h2>

As we saw in the last section, the qualitative idea behind ANOVA is to compare the two
sums of squares values SSb and SSw to each other. If the between-group variation SSb is large
relative to the within-group variation SSw then we have reason to suspect that the population
means for the different groups aren’t identical to each other. In order to convert this into a
workable hypothesis test, there’s a little bit of “fiddling around” needed. What I’ll do is first
show you what we do to calculate our test statistic, the F ratio, and then try to give you a feel
for why we do it this way.



In order to convert our SS values into an F-ratio the first thing we need to calculate is the
degrees of freedom associated with the SSb and SSw values. As usual, the degrees of freedom
corresponds to the number of unique “data points” that contribute to a particular calculation,
minus the number of “constraints” that they need to satisfy. For the within-groups variability
what we’re calculating is the variation of the individual observations (N data points) around the
group means (G constraints). In contrast, for the between groups variability we’re interested
in the variation of the group means (G data points) around the grand mean (1 constraint).
Therefore, the degrees of freedom here are:

$$df_b=G-1$$



$$df_w=N-G$$



Okay, that seems simple enough. What we do next is convert our summed squares value into a
“mean squares” value, which we do by dividing by the degrees of freedom:


$$MS_b=\frac{SS_b}{df_b}$$


$$MS_w=\frac{SS_w}{df_w}$$


Finally, we calculate the F-ratio by dividing the between-groups MS by the within-groups MS:


$$F=\frac{MS_b}{MS_w}$$



At a very general level, the intuition behind the F statistic is straightforward. Bigger values of
F means that the between-groups variation is large relative to the within-groups variation. As
a consequence, the larger the value of F the more evidence we have against the null hypothesis.
But how large does F have to be in order to actually reject H0? In order to understand this,
you need a slightly deeper understanding of what ANOVA is and what the mean squares values
actually are.

The next section discusses that in a bit of detail, but for readers that aren’t interested in
the details of what the test is actually measuring I’ll cut to the chase. In order to complete our
hypothesis test we need to know the sampling distribution for F if the null hypothesis is true.
Not surprisingly, the sampling distribution for the F <u>statistic</u> under the null hypothesis is an F
distribution. If you recall our discussion of the F distribution in Chapter <font color="blue"><b>7</b></font>, the F <u>distribution</u>
has two parameters, corresponding to the two degrees of freedom involved. The first one df1 is
the between groups degrees of freedom dfb, and the second one df2 is the within groups degrees
of freedom dfw.

<h2> 13.2.4 The model for the data and the meaning of F</h2>

At a fundamental level ANOVA is a competition between two different statistical models,
H0 and H1. When I described the null and alternative hypotheses at the start of the section, I
was a little imprecise about what these models actually are. I’ll remedy that now, though you
probably won’t like me for doing so. If you recall, our null hypothesis was that all of the group
means are identical to one another. If so, then a natural way to think about the outcome
variable Yik is to describe individual scores in terms of a single population mean µ, plus the
deviation from that population mean. This deviation is usually denoted ik and is traditionally
called the error or residual associated with that observation. Be careful though. Just like we
saw with the word “significant”, the word “error” has a technical meaning in statistics that
isn’t quite the same as its everyday English definition. In everyday language, “error” implies
a mistake of some kind, but in statistics it doesn’t (or at least, not necessarily). With that
in mind, the word “residual” is a better term than the word “error”. In statistics both words
mean “leftover variability”, that is “stuff” that the model can’t explain.


In any case, here’s what the null hypothesis looks like when we write it as a statistical
model


$$Y_{ik}=\mu+\epsilon_{ik}$$

where we make the assumption (discussed later) that the residual values ik are normally
distributed, with mean 0 and a standard deviation σ that is the same for all groups. To use
the notation that we introduced in Chapter <font color="blue"><b>7</b></font> we would write this assumption like this


$$\epsilon_{ik} \sim Normal(0,\sigma^2)$$

What about the alternative hypothesis, H1? The only difference between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis is that we allow each group to have a different population
mean. So, if we let µk denote the population mean for the k-th group in our experiment, then
the statistical model corresponding to H1 is

$$Y_{ik}=\mu_k+\epsilon_{ik}$$

where, once again, we assume that the error terms are normally distributed with mean 0 and
standard deviation σ. That is, the alternative hypothesis also assumes that \(  \epsilon \sim Normal(0,\sigma^2) \)

Okay, now that we’ve described the statistical models underpinning H0 and H1 in more
detail, it’s now pretty straightforward to say what the mean square values are measuring, and
what this means for the interpretation of F. I won’t bore you with the proof of this but it
turns out that the within-groups mean square, MSw, can be viewed as an estimator (in the
technical sense, Chapter <font color="blue"><b>8</b></font>) of the error variance σ
2
. The between-groups mean square MSb is
also an estimator, but what it estimates is the error variance plus a quantity that depends on
the true differences among the group means. If we call this quantity Q, then we can see that
the F-statistic is basically

$$F=\frac{\hat{Q}+\hat{\sigma}^2}{\hat{\sigma}^2}$$

where the true value Q “ 0 if the null hypothesis is true, and Q ą 0 if the alternative hypothesis
is true (e.g., <a href="https://lib.hpu.edu.vn/handle/123456789/26735"  target="_blank"><font color="blue">Hays 1994</font></a>, ch. 10). Therefore, at a bare minimum the F value must be larger
than 1 to have any chance of rejecting the null hypothesis. Note that this doesn’t mean that
it’s impossible to get an F-value less than 1. What it means is that if the null hypothesis is
true the sampling distribution of the F ratio has a mean of 1,b and so we need to see F-values
larger than 1 in order to safely reject the null.



To be a bit more precise about the sampling distribution, notice that if the null hypothesis
is true, both MSb and MSw are estimators of the variance of the residuals ik. If those residuals
are normally distributed, then you might suspect that the estimate of the variance of ik is chisquare distributed, because (as discussed in Section 7.6) that’s what a chi-square distribution
is: it’s what you get when you square a bunch of normally-distributed things and add them
up. And since the F distribution is (again, by definition) what you get when you take the ratio
between two things that are χ
2 distributed, we have our sampling distribution. Obviously, I’m
glossing over a whole lot of stuff when I say this, but in broad terms, this really is where our
sampling distribution comes from.

<h2> 13.2.5 A worked example</h2>



The previous discussion was fairly abstract and a little on the technical side, so I think
that at this point it might be useful to see a worked example. For that, let’s go back to the
clinical trial data that I introduced at the start of the chapter. The descriptive statistics that
we calculated at the beginning tell us our group means: an average mood gain of 0.45 for the
placebo, 0.72 for Anxifree, and 1.48 for Joyzepam. With that in mind, let’s party like it’s 1899 3
and start doing some pencil and paper calculations. I’ll only do this for the first 5 observations
because it’s not bloody 1899 and I’m very lazy. Let’s start by calculating SSw, the within-group
sums of squares. First, let’s draw up a nice table to help us with our calculations:


<table width="50%" border="1" ><caption></caption>
	<tr>
		<td> 
		group k 
 </td>
 		<td> 
		outcome \( Y_{ik} \)
 </td>
	</tr>
	 
		<tr>
		<td> 
		placebo
 </td>
 		<td> 
		0.5
 </td>
	</tr>
	
		<tr>
		<td> 
		placebo
 </td>
 		<td> 
		0.3
 </td>
	</tr>
	
			<tr>
		<td>

 </td>
 		<td>

	</tr>
				<tr>
		<td>

		0.6
 </td>
	</tr>
					<tr>
		<td> 
		anxifree
 </td>
 		<td> 
		0.4
 </td>
	</tr>
		
</table>

At this stage, the only thing I’ve included in the table is the raw data itself. That is, the
grouping variable (i.e., drug) and outcome variable (i.e. mood.gain) for each person. Note that
the outcome variable here corresponds to the Yik value in our equation previously. The next
step in the calculation is to write down, for each person in the study, the corresponding group
mean, Y¯
k. This is slightly repetitive but not particularly difficult since we already calculated
those group means when doing our descriptive statistics:




<table width="50%" border="1" ><caption></caption>
	<tr>
		<td> 
		group k 
 </td>
 		<td> 
		outcome \( Y_{ik} \)
 </td>
  		<td> 
		group mean \bar{Y}_k \)
 </td>
	</tr>
	 
		<tr>
		<td>

 </td>
 		<td> 
		0.5
 </td>
  		<td>

 </td>
	</tr>
	
		<tr>

 		<td>

	</tr>
	
			<tr>

  		<td>

	</tr>
				<tr>

  		<td>

					<tr>
		<td> 
		anxifree
 </td>
 		<td> 
		0.4
 </td>
  		<td> 
		0.72
 </td>
	</tr>
		
</table>


Now that we’ve written those down, we need to calculate, again for every person, the deviation
from the corresponding group mean. That is, we want to subtract \( Y_{ik} - \bar{Y}_k \). After we’ve done
that, we need to square everything. When we do that, here’s what we get:



<table width="50%" border="1" ><caption></caption>
	<tr>
		<td> 
		group k 
 </td>
 		<td> 
		outcome \( Y_{ik} \)
 </td>
  		<td>

		0.72
 </td>
  <td> 
		-0.32
 </td>
  		<td> 
		0.1003
 </td>
	</tr>
		
</table>


The last step is equally straightforward. In order to calculate the within-group sum of squares
we just add up the squared deviations across all observations:





$$

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
SS_w  & = 0.0025 + 0.0225 + 0.1225 + 0.0136 + 0.1003 \\
& =  0.2614
\end{split}
\end{equation}

$$




Of course, if we actually wanted to get the right answer we’d need to do this for all 18 observations
in the data set, not just the first five. We could continue with the pencil and paper calculations
if we wanted to, but it’s pretty tedious. Alternatively, it’s not too hard to do this in a dedicated
spreadsheet programme such as OpenOffice or Excel. Try and do it yourself. The one that I
did, in Excel, is in the file clinicaltrial anova.xls. When you do it you should end up with
a within-group sum of squares value of 1.39.

Okay. Now that we’ve calculated the within groups variation, SSw, it’s time to turn our
attention to the between-group sum of squares, SSb. The calculations for this case are very
similar. The main difference is that instead of calculating the differences between an observation
Yik and a group mean Y¯
k for all of the observations, we calculate the differences between the
group means Y¯
k and the grand mean Y¯ (in this case 0.88) for all of the groups.



<table width="50%" border="1" ><caption></caption>
	<tr>
		<td> 
		group k

 		<td> 
		group mean \( \bar{Y}_k \)
 </td>
  		<td> 
		grand mean  \( \bar{Y} \)
 </td>
 <td> 
		deviation </br> \( \bar{Y}_k - \bar{Y} \)
 </td>
  		<td> 
		squared deviation \(  ( \bar{Y}_k-\bar{Y})^2 \)
 </td>
	</tr>
	 
		<tr>
		<td>

 		<td>

  		<td>

  		<td>

	</tr>

		0.88 
 </td>
  <td>

 </td>
  		<td> 
		0.36
 </td>
	</tr>			
</table>

However, for the between group calculations we need to multiply each of these squared deviations
by Nk, the number of observations in the group. We do this because every observation in the
group (all Nk of them) is associated with a between group difference. So if there are six people
in the placebo group and the placebo group mean differs from the grand mean by 0.19, then the
total between group variation associated with these six people is 6 ˆ 0.19 “ 1.14. So we have to
extend our little table of calculations:




<table width="50%" border="1" ><caption></caption>
	<tr>
		<td> 
		group k 
 </td>
 		<td> 
		...
 </td>
  		<td> 
		 squared deviations  \( (\bar{Y}_k-\bar{Y})^2 \)
 </td>
 <td> 
		sample size </br> \( N_k \)
 </td>
  		<td> 
		weighted squared dev </br>  \(  N_k (\bar{Y}_k-\bar{Y})^2 \)
 </td>
	</tr>
	 
		<tr>
		<td> 
		placebo
 </td>
 		<td> 
		...
 </td>
  		<td> 
		0.19
 </td>
  <td> 
		6
 </td>
  		<td> 
		1.14
 </td>
	</tr>
	
		<tr>
		<td> 
		anxifree
 </td>
 		<td> 
		...
 </td>
  		<td> 
		0.03
 </td>
  <td> 
		6
 </td>
  		<td> 
		0.18
 </td>
	</tr>
	
			<tr>
		<td> 
		joyzepam
 </td>
 		<td> 
		...
 </td>
  		<td> 
		0.36 
 </td>
  <td> 
		6
 </td>
  		<td> 
		2.16
 </td>
	</tr>			
</table>

And so now our between group sum of squares is obtained by summing these “weighted squared
deviations” over all three groups in the study:



$$

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
SS_b  & = 1.14 + 0.18 + 2.16 \\
& =  3.48
\end{split}
\end{equation}

$$




As you can see, the between group calculations are a lot shorter4
. Now that we’ve calculated our
sums of squares values, SSb and SSw, the rest of the ANOVA is pretty painless. The next step
is to calculate the degrees of freedom. Since we have G “ 3 groups and N “ 18 observations in
total our degrees of freedom can be calculated by simple subtraction:





$$

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
df_b  & = G-1 & = 2  \\
df_w & =  N-G  & =  15
\end{split}
\end{equation}

$$



Next, since we’ve now calculated the values for the sums of squares and the degrees of freedom,
for both the within-groups variability and the between-groups variability, we can obtain the
mean square values by dividing one by the other:






$$

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
MS_b  & = \frac{SS_b}{df_b} & = \frac{3.48}{2} & = 1.74  \\
MS_w & = \frac{SS_w}{df_w}  & = \frac{1.39}{15} & =  0.09
\end{split}
\end{equation}

$$



We’re almost done. The mean square values can be used to calculate the F-value, which is the
test statistic that we’re interested in. We do this by dividing the between-groups MS value by
the within-groups MS value.



$$

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
F  & = \frac{MS_b}{MS_w} & = \frac{1.74}{0.09} & = 19.3
\end{split}
\end{equation}

$$


Woohooo! This is terribly exciting, yes? Now that we have our test statistic, the last step is to
find out whether the test itself gives us a significant result. As discussed in Chapter <font color="blue"><b>9</b></font> back in
the “old days” what we’d do is open up a statistics textbook or flick to the back section which
would actually have a huge lookup table and we would find the threshold F value corresponding
to a particular value of alpha (the null hypothesis rejection region), e.g. 0.05, 0.01 or 0.001, for
2 and 15 degrees of freedom. Doing it this way would give us a threshold F value for an alpha of
0.001 of 11.34. As this is less than our calculated F value we say that p ă 0.001. But those were
the old days, and nowadays fancy stats software calculates the exact p-value for you. In fact,
the exact p-value is 0.000071. So, unless we’re being extremely conservative about our Type I
error rate, we’re pretty much guaranteed to reject the null hypothesis.

At this point, we’re basically done. Having completed our calculations, it’s traditional to
organise all these numbers into an ANOVA table like the one in Table 13.1. For our clinical trial
data, the ANOVA table would look like this:





<table width="50%" border="1" ><caption></caption>

</table>




<dl>
<dt>
These days, you’ll probably never have much reason to want to construct one of these tables
yourself, but you will find that almost all statistical software (jamovi included) tends to organise
the output of an ANOVA into a table like this, so it’s a good idea to get used to reading them.
However, although the software will output a full ANOVA table, there’s almost never a good
reason to include the whole table in your write up. A pretty standard way of reporting this
result would be to write something like this:
</dt>
<dd>
One-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of drug on mood gain (Fp2, 15q “
19.3, p ă .001).
</dd>
</dl>

Sigh. So much work for one short sentence.



		
<h2> 13.3 Running an ANOVA in jamovi</h2>



I’m pretty sure I know what you’re thinking after reading the last section, especially if you
followed my advice and did all of that by pencil and paper (i.e., in a spreadsheet) yourself. Doing
the ANOVA calculations yourself sucks. There’s quite a lot of calculations that we needed to
do along the way, and it would be tedious to have to do this over and over again every time you
wanted to do an ANOVA.

		
<h3> 13.3.1 Using jamovi to specify your ANOVA</h3>


To make life easier for you, jamovi can do ANOVA..hurrah! Go to the ‘ANOVA’ - ‘ANOVA’
analysis, and move the mood.gain variable across so it is in the ‘Dependent Variable’ box, and
then move the drug variable across so it is in the ‘Fixed Factors’ box. This should give the
results as shown in Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.3</b></font>.
5 Note I have also checked the η
2
checkbox, pronounced “eta”
squared, under the ‘Effect Size’ option and this is also shown on the results table. We will come
back to effect sizes a bit later.



The jamovi results table shows you the sums of squares values, the degrees of freedom, and
a couple of other quantities that we’re not really interested in right now. Notice, however, that
jamovi doesn’t use the names “between-group” and “within-group”. Instead, it tries to assign
more meaningful names. In our particular example, the between groups variance corresponds to
the effect that the drug has on the outcome variable, and the within groups variance corresponds
to the “leftover” variability so it calls that the residuals. If we compare these numbers to the
numbers that I calculated by hand in Section 13.2.5, you can see that they’re more or less the
same, apart from rounding errors. The between groups sums of squares is SSb “ 3.45, the within
groups sums of squares is SSw “ 1.39, and the degrees of freedom are 2 and 15 respectively. We
also get the F-value and the p-value and, again, these are more or less the same, give or take
rounding errors, to the numbers that we calculated ourselves when doing it the long and tedious
way.

</figcaption>
<img src="images/Figure131.PNG" alt="Figure 13.3" />
</figure>




		
<h2> 13.4 Effect size</h2>

There’s a few different ways you could measure the effect size in an ANOVA, but the most
commonly used measures are η
2
(eta squared) and partial η
2
. For a one way analysis of
variance they’re identical to each other, so for the moment I’ll just explain η
2
. The definition of
η
2
is actually really simple



$$\eta^2=\frac{SS_b}{SS_{tot}}$$


That’s all it is. So when I look at the ANOVA table in Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.3</b></font>, I see that SSb “ 3.45 and
SStot “ 3.45 ` 1.39 “ 4.84. Thus we get an η
2 value of



$$\eta^2=\frac{3.45}{4.84}=0.71$$


The interpretation of η
2
is equally straightforward. It refers to the proportion of the variability
in the outcome variable (mood.gain) that can be explained in terms of the predictor (drug). A
value of η
2 “ 0 means that there is no relationship at all between the two, whereas a value of
η
2 “ 1 means that the relationship is perfect. Better yet, the η
2 value is very closely related to
R2
, as discussed previously in Section 12.6.1), and has an equivalent interpretation.


Although many statistics text books suggest η
2 as the default effect size measure in ANOVA,
there’s an interesting blog post by Daniel Lakens suggesting that eta-squared is perhaps not
the best measure of effect size in real world data analysis, because it can be a biased estimator (http://daniellakens.blogspot.com.au/2015/06/why-you-should-use-omega-square
d.html). Usefully, there is also an option in jamovi to specify omega-squared (ω
2
), which is less
biased, alongside eta-squared.



		
<h3> 13.5 Multiple comparisons and post hoc tests</h3>



Any time you run an ANOVA with more than two groups and you end up with a significant
effect, the first thing you’ll probably want to ask is which groups are actually different from
one another. In our drugs example, our null hypothesis was that all three drugs (placebo,
Anxifree and Joyzepam) have the exact same effect on mood. But if you think about it, the
null hypothesis is actually claiming three different things all at once here. Specifically, it claims
that:


<ul>
<li>
Your competitor’s drug (Anxifree) is no better than a placebo (i.e., µA “ µP )
</li>
<li>
Your drug (Joyzepam) is no better than a placebo (i.e., µJ “ µP )
</li>
<li>
Anxifree and Joyzepam are equally effective (i.e., µJ “ µA)
</li>
</ul>


If any one of those three claims is false, then the null hypothesis is also false. So, now that we’ve
rejected our null hypothesis, we’re thinking that at least one of those things isn’t true. But
which ones? All three of these propositions are of interest. Since you certainly want to know if
your new drug Joyzepam is better than a placebo, it would be nice to know how well it stacks
up against an existing commercial alternative (i.e., Anxifree). It would even be useful to check
the performance of Anxifree against the placebo. Even if Anxifree has already been extensively
tested against placebos by other researchers, it can still be very useful to check that your study
is producing similar results to earlier work.




When we characterise the null hypothesis in terms of these three distinct propositions, it
becomes clear that there are eight possible “states of the world” that we need to distinguish
between:

By rejecting the null hypothesis, we’ve decided that we don’t believe that #1 is the true state
of the world. The next question to ask is, which of the other seven possibilities do we think
is right? When faced with this situation, its usually helps to look at the data. For instance,
if we look at the plots in Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.1</b></font>, it’s tempting to conclude that Joyzepam is better than
the placebo and better than Anxifree, but there’s no real difference between Anxifree and the
placebo. However, if we want to get a clearer answer about this, it might help to run some tests.




		
<h3> 13.5.1 Running “pairwise” t-tests</h3>



How might we go about solving our problem? Given that we’ve got three separate pairs of
means (placebo versus Anxifree, placebo versus Joyzepam, and Anxifree versus Joyzepam) to
compare, what we could do is run three separate t-tests and see what happens. This is easy to
do in jamovi. Go to the ANOVA ‘Post Hoc Tests’ options, move the ‘drug’ variable across into
the active box on the right, and then click on the ‘No correction’ checkbox. This will produce
a neat table showing all the pairwise t-test comparisons amongst the three levels of the drug
variable, as in Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.4</b></font>.



<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 13.4: Uncorrected pairwise t-tests as post hoc comparisons in jamovi
</figcaption>
<img src="images/Figure132.PNG" alt="Figure 13.4" />
</figure>



		
<h3> 13.5.2 Corrections for multiple testing</h3>




In the previous section I hinted that there’s a problem with just running lots and lots of
t-tests. The concern is that, when running these analyses, what we’re doing is going on a “fishing
expedition”. We’re running lots and lots of tests without much theoretical guidance in the hope
that some of them come up significant. This kind of theory-free search for group differences is
referred to as post hoc analysis (“post hoc” being Latin for “after this”).


It’s okay to run post hoc analyses, but a lot of care is required. For instance, the analysis
that I ran in the previous section should be avoided, as each individual t-test is designed to
have a 5% Type I error rate (i.e., α “ .05) and I ran three of these tests. Imagine what would
have happened if my ANOVA involved 10 different groups, and I had decided to run 45 “post
hoc” t-tests to try to find out which ones were significantly different from each other, you’d
expect 2 or 3 of them to come up significant by chance alone. As we saw in Chapter <font color="blue"><b>9</b></font>, the
central organising principle behind null hypothesis testing is that we seek to control our Type
I error rate, but now that I’m running lots of t-tests at once in order to determine the source
of my ANOVA results, my actual Type I error rate across this whole family of tests has gotten
completely out of control.



The usual solution to this problem is to introduce an adjustment to the p-value, which aims
to control the total error rate across the family of tests 
(see <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ps.46.020195.003021?journalCode=psych"  target="_blank"><font color="blue">Shaffer 1995</font></a>). An adjustment of
this form, which is usually (but not always) applied because one is doing post hoc analysis, is
often referred to as a correction for multiple comparisons, though it is sometimes referred
to as “simultaneous inference”. In any case, there are quite a few different ways of doing this
adjustment. I’ll discuss a few of them in this section and in Section 14.8, but you should be
aware that there are many other methods out there 
(see, e.g., <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Multiple-Comparisons-Theory-and-Methods/Hsu/p/book/9780412982811"  target="_blank"><font color="blue">(Hsu 1996)</font></a>.




		
<h3> 13.5.3 Bonferroni corrections</h3>

The simplest of these adjustments is called the Bonferroni correction (Dunn 1961), and
it’s very very simple indeed. Suppose that my post hoc analysis consists of m separate tests,
and I want to ensure that the total probability of making any Type I errors at all is at most α.
7
If so, then the Bonferroni correction just says “multiply all your raw p-values by m”. If we let
p denote the original p-value, and let p
1
j
be the corrected value, then the Bonferroni correction
tells that:



$$p_j^{'}=m \times p$$



<dl>
<dt>
And therefore, if you’re using the Bonferroni correction, you would reject the null hypothesis if
p
1
j ă α. The logic behind this correction is very straightforward. We’re doing m different tests,
so if we arrange it so that each test has a Type I error rate of at most α{m, then the total Type
I error rate across these tests cannot be larger than α. That’s pretty simple, so much so that in
the original paper, the author writes,
</dt>
<dd>
The method given here is so simple and so general that I am sure it must have been
used before this. I do not find it, however, so can only conclude that perhaps its
very simplicity has kept statisticians from realizing that it is a very good method in
some situations (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1961.10482090"  target="_blank"><font color="blue">Dunn 1961</font></a>, pp 52-53)
</dd>
</dl>

To use the Bonferroni correction in jamovi, just click on the ‘Bonferroni’ checkbox in the ‘Correction’ options, and you will see another column added to the ANOVA results table showing
the adjusted p-values for the Bonferroni correction (13.4). If we compare these three p-values to
those for the uncorrected, pairwise t-tests, it is clear that the only thing that jamovi has done
is multiply them by 3.

<h3> 13.5.4 Holm corrections</h3>


Although the Bonferroni correction is the simplest adjustment out there, it’s not usually the
best one to use. One method that is often used instead is the Holm correction (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1961.10482090"  target="_blank"><font color="blue">Holm 1979</font></a>).
The idea behind the Holm correction is to pretend that you’re doing the tests sequentially,
starting with the smallest (raw) p-value and moving onto the largest one. For the j-th largest
of the p-values, the adjustment is either

$$p_j^{'}=j \times p_j$$


(i.e., the biggest p-value remains unchanged, the second biggest p-value is doubled, the third
biggest p-value is tripled, and so on), or

$$p_j^{'}=p_{j+1}^{'}$$


whichever one is larger. This might sound a little confusing, so let’s go through it a little more
slowly. Here’s what the Holm correction does. First, you sort all of your p-values in order, from
smallest to largest. For the smallest p-value all you do is multiply it by m, and you’re done.
However, for all the other ones it’s a two-stage process. For instance, when you move to the
second smallest p value, you first multiply it by m ´ 1. If this produces a number that is bigger
than the adjusted p-value that you got last time, then you keep it. But if it’s smaller than the
last one, then you copy the last p-value. To illustrate how this works, consider the table below,
which shows the calculations of a Holm correction for a collection of five p-values:

Hopefully that makes things clear.


Although it’s a little harder to calculate, the Holm correction has some very nice properties.
It’s more powerful than Bonferroni (i.e., it has a lower Type II error rate) but, counter-intuitive
as it might seem, it has the same Type I error rate. As a consequence, in practice there’s
never any reason to use the simpler Bonferroni correction since it is always outperformed by the
slightly more elaborate Holm correction. Because of this, the Holm correction should be your
go to multiple comparison correction. Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.4</b></font> also shows the Holm corrected p-values and,
as you can see, the biggest p-value (corresponding to the comparison between Anxifree and the
placebo) is unaltered. At a value of .15, it is exactly the same as the value we got originally when
we applied no correction at all. In contrast, the smallest p-value (Joyzepam versus placebo) has
been multiplied by three.




		
<h3> 13.5.5 Writing up the post hoc test</h3>



<dl>
<dt>
Finally, having run the post hoc analysis to determine which groups are significantly different
to one another, you might write up the result like this:
</dt>
<dd>
Post hoc tests (using the Holm correction to adjust p) indicated that Joyzepam
produced a significantly larger mood change than both Anxifree (p “ .001) and the
placebo (p “ 9.0ˆ10´5
). We found no evidence that Anxifree performed better than
the placebo (p “ .15).

</dd>
</dl>


Or, if you don’t like the idea of reporting exact p-values, then you’d change those numbers to
p ă .01, p ă .001 and p ą .05 respectively. Either way, the key thing is that you indicate that
you used Holm’s correction to adjust the p-values. And of course, I’m assuming that elsewhere
in the write up you’ve included the relevant descriptive statistics (i.e., the group means and
standard deviations), since these p-values on their own aren’t terribly informative.



<h2> 13.6 Assumptions of one-way ANOVA</h2>


Like any statistical test, analysis of variance relies on some assumptions about the data, specifically the residuals. There are three key assumptions that you need to be aware of: normality,
homogeneity of variance and independence.



<table width="100%" border="1" ><caption></caption>
	<tr>
		<td> If you remember back to Section 13.2.4, which I hope you at least skimmed even if you didn’t
read the whole thing, I described the statistical models underpinning ANOVA in this way:

$$H_0:Y_{ik}=\mu + \epsilon{ik}$$

$$H_1:Y_{ik}=\mu_k + \epsilon{ik}$$

In these equations µ refers to a single grand population mean which is the same for all groups,
and µk is the population mean for the k-th group. Up to this point we’ve been mostly interested
in whether our data are best described in terms of a single grand mean (the null hypothesis)
or in terms of different group-specific means (the alternative hypothesis). This makes sense,
of course, as that’s actually the important research question! However, all of our testing
procedures have, implicitly, relied on a specific assumption about the residuals, ik, namely
that

$$\epsilon_{ik} \sim Normal(0,\sigma^2)$$

None of the maths works properly without this bit. Or, to be precise, you can still do all
the calculations and you’ll end up with an F-statistic, but you have no guarantee that this
F-statistic actually measures what you think it’s measuring, and so any conclusions that you
might draw on the basis of the F test might be wrong.



 </td>
	</tr>
</table>


So, how do we check whether the assumption about the residuals is accurate? Well, as I
indicated above, there are three distinct claims buried in this one statement, and we’ll consider
them separately.

<ul>
<li>
Homogeneity of variance. Notice that we’ve only got the one value for the population
standard deviation (i.e., σ), rather than allowing each group to have it’s own value (i.e.,
σk). This is referred to as the homogeneity of variance (sometimes called homoscedasticity)
assumption. ANOVA assumes that the population standard deviation is the same for all
groups. We’ll talk about this extensively in Section 13.6.1.
</li>
<li>
Normality. The residuals are assumed to be normally distributed. As we saw in Section 11.8, we can assess this by looking at QQ plots (or running a Shapiro-Wilk test. I’ll
talk about this more in an ANOVA context in Section 13.6.4.
</li>
<li>
Independence. The independence assumption is a little trickier. What it basically means
is that, knowing one residual tells you nothing about any other residual. All of the ik
values are assumed to have been generated without any “regard for” or “relationship to”
any of the other ones. There’s not an obvious or simple way to test for this, but there
are some situations that are clear violations of this. For instance, if you have a repeatedmeasures design, where each participant in your study appears in more than one condition,
then independence doesn’t hold. There’s a special relationship between some observations,
namely those that correspond to the same person! When that happens, you need to use
something like repeated measures ANOVA (see Section 13.8).
</li>
</ul>



<h3> 13.6.1  Checking the homogeneity of variance assumption</h3>


<blockquote>
<em>To make the preliminary test on variances is rather like putting to sea in a rowing
boat to find out whether conditions are sufficiently calm for an ocean liner to leave
port!</em> <br />
– George Box <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2333350"  target="_blank"><font color="blue"> (Box 1953)
</font></a>
</blockquote>



There’s more than one way to skin a cat, as the saying goes, and more than one way to test
the homogeneity of variance assumption, too (though for some reason no-one made a saying out
of that). The most commonly used test for this that I’ve seen in the literature is the Levene
test (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2004242"  target="_blank"><font color="blue">Levene 1960</font></a>), and the closely related Brown-Forsythe test (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2285659"  target="_blank"><font color="blue">Brown and Forsythe 1974</font></a>).



Regardless of whether you’re doing the standard Levene test or the Brown-Forsythe test, the
test statistic, which is sometimes denoted F but also sometimes written as W, is calculated in
exactly the same way that the F-statistic for the regular ANOVA is calculated, just using a Zik
rather than Yik. With that in mind, we can go on to look at how to run the test in jamovi.




<table width="100%" border="1" ><caption></caption>
	<tr>
		<td> 
		The Levene test is shockingly simple. Suppose we have our outcome variable Yik. All we do
is define a new variable, which I’ll call Zik, corresponding to the absolute deviation from the
group mean

$$Z_{ik}=|Y_{ik}-\bar{Y}_{k}|$$


Okay, what good does this do us? Well, let’s take a moment to think about what Zik actually
is and what we’re trying to test. The value of Zik is a measure of how the i-th observation
in the k-th group deviates from its group mean. And our null hypothesis is that all groups
have the same variance, i.e., the same overall deviations from the group means! So the null
hypothesis in a Levene test is that the population means of Z are identical for all groups.
Hmm. So what we need now is a statistical test of the null hypothesis that all group means
are identical. Where have we seen that before? Oh right, that’s what ANOVA is, and so all
that the Levene test does is run an ANOVA on the new variable Zik.


What about the Brown-Forsythe test? Does that do anything particularly different? Nope.
The only change from the Levene test is that it constructs the transformed variable Z in a
slightly different way, using deviations from the group medians rather than deviations from
the group means. That is, for the Brown-Forsythe test


$$Z_{ik}=|Y_{ik}-median_k(Y)|$$

where median_k(Y) is the median for group k.

	</tr>

<h3> 13.6.2  Running the Levene test in jamovi</h3>


Okay, so how do we run the Levene test? Simple really - under the ANOVA ‘Assumption
Checks’ option, just click on the ‘Homogeneity tests’ checkbox. If we look at the output, shown
in Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.5</b></font>, we see that the test is non-significant pF2,15 “ 1.45, p “ .266q, so it looks like the
homogeneity of variance assumption is fine. However, looks can be deceptive! If your sample size
is pretty big, then the Levene test could show up a significant effect (i.e. p ă .05) even when the
homogeneity of variance assumption is not violated to an extent which troubles the robustness
of ANOVA. This was the point George Box was making in the quote above. Similarly, if your
sample size is quite small, then the homogeneity of variance assumption might not be satisfied
and yet a Levene test could be non-significant (i.e. p ą .05). What this means is that, alongside
any statistical test of the assumption being met, you should always plot the standard deviation
around the means for each group / category in the analysis...just to see if they look fairly similar
(i.e. homogeneity of variance) or not.



<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 13.5: Levene test output for one-way ANOVA in jamovi
</figcaption>
<img src="images/Figure133.PNG" alt="Figure 13.5" />
</figure>



<h3> 13.6.3  Removing the homogeneity of variance assumption</h3>


In our example, the homogeneity of variance assumption turned out to be a pretty safe one:
the Levene test came back non-significant (notwithstanding that we should also look at the plot
of standard deviations), so we probably don’t need to worry. However, in real life we aren’t
always that lucky. How do we save our ANOVA when the homogeneity of variance assumption
is violated? If you recall from our discussion of t-tests, we’ve seen this problem before. The
Student t-test assumes equal variances, so the solution was to use the Welch t-test, which does
not. In fact, Welch (1951) also showed how we can solve this problem for ANOVA too (the
Welch one-way test). It’s implemented in jamovi using the One-Way ANOVA analysis. This is a
specific analysis approach just for one-way ANOVA, and to run the Welch one-way ANOVA for
our example, we would re-run the analysis as previously, but this time use the jamovi ANOVA -
One Way ANOVA analysis command, and check the option for Welch’s test (see Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.6</b></font>.
To understand what’s happening here, let’s compare these numbers to what we got earlier in
Section 13.3 when we ran our original ANOVA. To save you the trouble of flicking back, this
is what we got last time: Fp2, 15q “ 18.611, p “ .00009, also shown as the Fisher’s test in the
One-Way ANOVA shown in Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.6</b></font>.





<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 13.6: Welch’s test as part of the One Way ANOVA analysis in jamovi
</figcaption>
<img src="images/Figure134.PNG" alt="Figure 13.6" />
</figure>



Okay, so originally our ANOVA gave us the result Fp2, 15q “ 18.6, whereas the Welch oneway test gave us Fp2, 9.49q “ 26.32. In other words, the Welch test has reduced the within-groups
degrees of freedom from 15 to 9.49, and the F-value has increased from 18.6 to 26.32.





<h3> 13.6.4  Checking the normality assumption</h3>



Testing the normality assumption is relatively straightforward. We covered most of what
you need to know in Section 11.8. The only thing we really need to do is draw a QQ plot and,
in addition if it is available, run the Shapiro-Wilk test. The QQ plot is shown in Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.7</b></font>
and it looks pretty normal to me. If the Shapiro-Wilk test is not significant (i.e. p ą .05) then
this indicates that the assumption of normality is not violated. However, as with Levene’s test,
if the sample size is large then a significant Shapiro-Wilk test may in fact be a false positive,
where the assumption of normality is not violated in any substantive problematic sense for the
analysis. And, similarly, a very small sample can produce false negatives. That’s why a visual
inspection of the QQ plot is important.


Alongside inspecting the QQ plot for any deviations from normality, the Shapiro-Wilk test
for our data does show a non-significant effect, with p “ 0.6053 (see Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.6</b></font>). This therefore
supports the QQ plot assessment; both checks find no indication that normality is violated.




<h2> 13.7  Removing the normality assumption</h2>



Now that we’ve seen how to check for normality, we are led naturally to ask what we can do
to address violations of normality. In the context of a one-way ANOVA, the easiest solution
is probably to switch to a non-parametric test (i.e., one that doesn’t rely on any particular
assumption about the kind of distribution involved). We’ve seen non-parametric tests before, in
Chapter <font color="blue"><b>11</b></font>. When you only have two groups, the Mann-Whitney or the Wilcoxon test provides
the non-parametric alternative that you need. When you’ve got three or more groups, you can
use the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (Kruskal and Wallis 1952). So that’s the test we’ll
talk about next.


<h3> 13.7.1  The logic behind the Kruskal-Wallis test</h3>



The Kruskal-Wallis test is surprisingly similar to ANOVA, in some ways. In ANOVA we started
with Yik, the value of the outcome variable for the ith person in the kth group. For the KruskalWallis test what we’ll do is rank order all of these Yik values and conduct our analysis on the
ranked data.




<table width="100%" border="1" ><caption></caption>
	<tr>
		<td> 
		So let’s let Rik refer to the ranking given to the ith member of the kth group. Now, let’s
calculate R¯
k, the average rank given to observations in the kth group

$$\bar{R}_k=\frac{1}{N_k}\sum_i R_{ik}$$

and let’s also calculate R¯, the grand mean rank

$$\bar{R}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_i\sum_k R_{ik}$$

Now that we’ve done this, we can calculate the squared deviations from the grand mean rank
R¯. When we do this for the individual scores, i.e., if we calculate pRik ´ R¯q
2
, what we have
is a “nonparametric” measure of how far the ik-th observation deviates from the grand mean
rank. When we calculate the squared deviation of the group means from the grand means,
i.e., if we calculate pR¯
k ´ R¯q
2
, then what we have is a nonparametric measure of how much
the group deviates from the grand mean rank. With this in mind, we’ll follow the same logic
that we did with ANOVA and define our ranked sums of squares measures, much like we did
earlier. First, we have our “total ranked sums of squares”


$$RSS_{tot}=\sum_k\sum_i (R_{ik}-\bar{R})^2$$


and we can define the “between groups ranked sums of squares” like this

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
RSS_{b}& =\sum{k}\sum_{i}(\bar{R}_{k}-\bar{R})^2
& = \sum_{k} N_k (\bar{R}_{k}-\bar{R})^2
\end{split}
\end{equation}

So, if the null hypothesis is true and there are no true group differences at all, you’d expect the
between group rank sums RSSb to be very small, much smaller than the total rank sums RSStot.
Qualitatively this is very much the same as what we found when we went about constructing
the ANOVA F-statistic, but for technical reasons the Kruskal-Wallis test statistic, usually
denoted K, is constructed in a slightly different way,


$$K=(N-1) \times \frac{RSS_b}{RSS_{tot}}$$

and if the null hypothesis is true, then the sampling distribution of K is approximately chisquare with G´1 degrees of freedom (where G is the number of groups). The larger the value
of K, the less consistent the data are with the null hypothesis, so this is a one-sided test. We
reject H0 when K is sufficiently large.




<h3> 13.7.2  Additional details</h3>

The description in the previous section illustrates the logic behind the Kruskal-Wallis test.
At a conceptual level, this is the right way to think about how the test works. However, from a
purely mathematical perspective it’s needlessly complicated. I won’t show you the derivation,
but you can use a bit of algebraic jiggery-pokerya
to show that the equation for K can be
rewritten as


$$K=\frac{12}{N(N-1)}\sum_k N_k \bar{R}_k^2 -3(N+1)$$

It’s this last equation that you sometimes see given for K. This is way easier to calculate than
the version I described in the previous section, but it’s just that it’s totally meaningless to
actual humans. It’s probably best to think of K the way I described it earlier, as an analogue
of ANOVA based on ranks. But keep in mind that the test statistic that gets calculated ends
up with a rather different look to it than the one we used for our original ANOVA.

But wait, there’s more! Dear lord, why is there always more? The story I’ve told so far
is only actually true when there are no ties in the raw data. That is, if there are no two
observations that have exactly the same value. If there are ties, then we have to introduce a
correction factor to these calculations. At this point I’m assuming that even the most diligent
reader has stopped caring (or at least formed the opinion that the tie-correction factor is
something that doesn’t require their immediate attention). So I’ll very quickly tell you how
it’s calculated, and omit the tedious details about why it’s done this way. Suppose we construct
a frequency table for the raw data, and let fj be the number of observations that have the
j-th unique value. This might sound a bit abstract, so here’s a concrete example from the
frequency table of mood.gain from the clinicaltrials.csv data set:

<table width="50%" border="1" ><caption></caption>

Looking at this table, notice that the third entry in the frequency table has a value of 2. Since
this corresponds to a mood.gain of 0.3, this table is telling us that two people’s mood increased
by 0.3. More to the point, in the mathematical notation I introduced above, this is telling us
that f3 “ 2. Yay. So, now that we know this, the tie correction factor (TCF) is:

$$TFC=1-\frac{\sum_j f_j^3 - f_j}{N^3 - N}$$


The tie-corrected value of the Kruskal-Wallis statistic is obtained by dividing the value of K
by this quantity. It is this tie-corrected version that jamovi calculates. And at long last, we’re
actually finished with the theory of the Kruskal-Wallis test. I’m sure you’re all terribly relieved
that I’ve cured you of the existential anxiety that naturally arises when you realise that you
don’t know how to calculate the tie-correction factor for the Kruskal-Wallis test. Right?

<h3> 13.7.3  How to run the Kruskal-Wallis test in jamovi</h3>




Despite the horror that we’ve gone through in trying to understand what the KruskalWallis test actually does, it turns out that running the test is pretty painless, since jamovi has
an analysis as part of the ANOVA analysis set called ‘Non-Parametric’ - ‘One Way ANOVA
(Kruskall-Wallis)’ Most of the time you’ll have data like the clinicaltrial.csv data set, in
which you have your outcome variable mood.gain and a grouping variable drug. If so, you can
just go ahead and run the analysis in jamovi. What this gives us is a Kruskal-Wallis χ
2 =
12.076, df = 2, p-value = 0.00239, as in Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.8</b></font>

<h2>13.8  Repeated measures one-way ANOVA</h2>


The one-way repeated measures ANOVA test is a statistical method of testing for significant
differences between three or more groups where the same participants are used in each group
(or each participant is closely matched with participants in other experimental groups). For this
reason, there should always be an equal number of scores (data points) in each experimental
group. This type of design and analysis can also be called a ‘related ANOVA’ or a ‘withinsubjects ANOVA’.

The logic behind a repeated measures ANOVA is very similar to that of an independent
ANOVA (sometimes called a ‘between-subjects’ ANOVA). You’ll remember that earlier we
showed that in a between-subjects ANOVA total variability is partitioned into between-groups
variability (SSb) and within-groups variability (SSw), and after each is divided by the respective
degrees of freedom to give MSb and MSw (see Table 13.1) the F-ratio is calculated as:



$$F=\frac{MS_b}{MS_w}$$

In a repeated measures ANOVA, the F-ratio is calculated in a similar way, but whereas in
an independent ANOVA the within-group variability (SSw) is used as the basis for the MSw
denominator, in a repeated measures ANOVA the SSw is partioned into two parts. As we are
using the same subjects in each group, we can remove the variability due to the individual
differences between subjects (referred to as SSsubjects) from the within-groups variability. We
won’t go into too much technical detail about how this is done, but essentially each subject
becomes a level of a factor called subjects. The variability in this within-subjects factor is then
calculated in the same way as any between-subjects factor. And then we can subtract SSsubjects
from SSw to provide a smaller SSerror term:



$$Independent ANOVA: SS_error = SS_w$$

$$Repeated Measures ANOVA: SS_error = SS_w - SS_subjects$$



This change in SSerror term often leads to a more powerful statistical test, but this does
depend on whether the reduction in the SSerror more than compensates for the reduction in
degrees of freedom for the error term (as degrees of freedom go from (n - k)8
to (n - 1)(k - 1)
(remembering that there are more subjects in the independent ANOVA design).



<h3>13.8.1  Repeated measures ANOVA in jamovi</h3>


First, we need some data. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/language-and-the-brain/"  target="_blank"><font color="blue">Geschwind (1972)</font></a> has suggested that the exact nature of a patient’s language deficit following a stroke can be used to diagnose the specific region of the brain
that has been damaged. A researcher is concerned with identifying the specific communication difficulties experienced by six patients suffering from Broca’s Aphasia (a language deficit
commonly experienced following a stroke).

The patients were required to complete three word recognition tasks. On the first (speech
production) task, patients were required to repeat single words read out aloud by the researcher.
On the second (conceptual) task, designed to test word comprehension, patients were required
to match a series of pictures with their correct name. On the third (syntax) task, designed
to test knowledge of correct word order, patients were asked to reorder syntactically incorrect
sentences. Each patient completed all three tasks. The order in which patients attempted the
tasks was counterbalanced between participants. Each task consisted of a series of 10 attempts.
The number of attempts successfully completed by each patient are shown in Table 13.2. Enter
these data into jamovi ready for analysis (or take a short-cut and load up the broca.csv file).



To perform a one-way related ANOVA in jamovi, open the one-way repeated measures
ANOVA dialogue box, as in Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.9</b></font>, via ANOVA - Repeated Measures ANOVA. Then:





<ul>

<li>
Enter a Repeated Measures Factor Name. This should be a label that you choose to
describe the conditions repeated by all participants. For example, to describe the speech,
conceptual and syntax tasks completed by all participants a suitable label would be ‘Task’.
Note that this new factor name represents the independent variable in the analysis.
</li>
<li>
Add a third level in the Repeated Measures Factors text box, as there are three levels
representing the three tasks: speech, conceptual and syntax. Change the labels of the
levels accordingly.
</li>
<li>
Then move each of the levels variables across to the Repeated Measures Cells text box.
</li>
<li>
Finally, under the Assumption Checks option, tick the “Sphericity checks” text box.
</li>

</ul>

jamovi output for a one-way repeated measures ANOVA is produced as shown in the Figures
<font color="blue"><b>13.10</b></font> to <font color="blue"><b>13.13</b></font>. The first output we should look at is Mauchly’s Test of Sphericity, which tests
the hypothesis that the variances of the differences between the conditions are equal (meaning
that the spread of difference scores between the study conditions is approximately the same).
In Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.10</b></font>, Mauchly’s test significance level is p “ .720. If Mauchly’s test is non-significant
(i.e. p ą .05, as is the case in this analysis) then it is reasonable to conclude that the variances
of the differences are not significantly different (i.e. they are roughly equal and sphericity can
be assumed.).



If, on the other hand, Mauchly’s test had been significant (p ă .05) then we would conclude
that there are significant differences between the variance of the differences, and the requirement
of sphericity has not been met. In this case, we should apply a correction to the F-value obtained
in the one-way related ANOVA analysis:





<ul>

<li>
If the Greenhouse-Geisser value in the “Tests of Sphericity” table is ą .75 then you should
use the Huynh-Feldt correction.
</li>

<li>
But if the Greenhouse-Geisser value is ă .75, then you should use the Greenhouse-Geisser
correction.
</li>

</ul>



Both these corrected F-values can be specified in the Sphericity Corrections check boxes
under the Assumption Checks options, and the corrected F-values are then shown in the results
table, as in Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.11</b></font>.



In our analysis, we saw that the significance of Mauchly’s Test of Sphericity was p “ .720
(i.e. p ą 0.05). So, this means we can assume that the requirement of sphericity has been
met so no correction to the F-value is needed. Therefore, we can use the ‘None’ Sphericity
Correction output values for the repeated measure ‘Task’: F “ 6.93, df “ 2, p “ .013, and
we can conclude that the number of tests successfully completed on each language task did
vary significantly depending on whether the task was speech, comprehension or syntax based
(Fp2, 10q “ 6.93, p “ .013).



Post-hoc tests can also be specified in jamovi for repeated measures ANOVA in the same
way as for independent ANOVA. The results are shown in Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.12</b></font>. These indicate that
there is a significant difference between Speech and Syntax, but not between other levels.


Descriptive statistics (marginal means) can be reviewed to help interpret the results, produced in the jamovi output as in Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.13</b></font>. Comparison of the mean number of trials
successfully completed by participants shows that Broca’s Aphasics perform reasonably well on
speech production (mean “ 7.17) and language comprehension (mean “ 6.17) tasks. However,
their performance was considerably worse on the syntax task (mean “ 4.33), with a significant
difference in post-hoc tests between Speech and Syntax task performance.

<h2>13.9  The Friedman non-parametric repeated measures ANOVA test</h2>



The Friedman test is a non-parametric version of a repeated measures ANOVA and can be used
instead of the Kruskall-Wallis test when testing for differences between three or more groups
where the same participants are in each group, or each participant is closely matched with
participants in other conditions. If the dependent variable is ordinal, or if the assumption of
normality is not met, then the Friedman test can be used.

As with the Kruskall-Wallis test, the underlying mathematics is complicated, and won’t be
presented here. For the purpose of this book, it is sufficient to note that jamovi calculates the
tie-corrected version of the Friedman test, and in Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.14</b></font> there is an example using the
Broca’s Aphasia data we have already looked at.


It’s pretty straightforward to run a Friedman test in jamovi. Just select Analyses - ANOVA
- Repeated Measures ANOVA (Non-parametric), as in Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.14</b></font>. Then highlight and transfer
the names of the repeated measures variables you wish to compare (Speech, Conceptual, Syntax)
into the ‘Measures:’ text box. To produce descriptive statistics (means and medians) for the
three repeated measures variables, click on the Descriptives button

The jamovi results show descriptive statistics, chi-square value, degrees of freedom, and the
p-value (Figure <font color="blue"><b>13.14</b></font>). Since the p-value is less than the level conventionally used to determine
significance (p ă .05), we can conclude that Broca’s Aphasics perform reasonably well on speech
production (median “ 7.5) and language comprehension (median “ 6.5) tasks. However, their
performance was considerably worse on the syntax task (median “ 4.5), with a significant
difference in post-hoc tests between Speech and Syntax task performance.




<h3>13.10  On the relationship between ANOVA and the Student t-test</h3>



There’s one last thing I want to point out before finishing. It’s something that a lot of people find
kind of surprising, but it’s worth knowing about. An ANOVA with two groups is identical to the
Student t-test. No, really. It’s not just that they are similar, but they are actually equivalent in
every meaningful way. I won’t try to prove that this is always true, but I will show you a single
concrete demonstration. Suppose that, instead of running an ANOVA on our mood.gain ~ drug
model, let’s instead do it using therapy as the predictor. If we run this ANOVA we get an
F-statistic of Fp1, 16q “ 1.71, and a p-value = 0.21. Since we only have two groups, I didn’t
actually need to resort to an ANOVA, I could have just decided to run a Student t-test. So
let’s see what happens when I do that: I get a t-statistic of tp16q “ ´1.3068 and a p-value =
0.21. Curiously, the p-values are identical. Once again we obtain a value of p “ .21. But what
about the test statistic? Having run a t-test instead of an ANOVA, we get a somewhat different
answer, namely tp16q “ ´1.3068. However, there is a fairly straightforward relationship here. If
we square the t-statistic then we get the F-statistic from before: ´1.30682 “ 1.7077



<h2>13.11  Summary</h2>



There’s a fair bit covered in this chapter, but there’s still a lot missing. Most obviously, I haven’t
discussed how to run an ANOVA when you are interested in more than one grouping variable,
but that will be discussed in a lot of detail in Chapter <font color="blue"><b>14</b></font>. In terms of what we have discussed,
the key topics were:








<ul>

<li>
The basic logic behind how ANOVA works (Section 13.2) and how to run one in jamovi
(Section 13.3).
</li>

<li>
How to compute an effect size for an ANOVA (Section 13.4)
</li>

<li>
Post-hoc analysis and corrections for multiple testing (Section 13.5).
</li>

<li>
The assumptions made by ANOVA (Section 13.6).
</li>

<li>
How to check the homogeneity of variance assumption (Section 13.6.1) and what to do if
it is violated (Section 13.6.3).
</li>

<li>
How to check the normality assumption (Section 13.6.4) and what to do if it is violated
(Section 13.7).
</li>

<li>
Repeated measures ANOVA (Section 13.8) and the non-parametric equivalent, the Friedman test (Section 13.9).
</li>

</ul>


As with all of the chapters in this book, there are quite a few different sources that I’ve relied
upon, but the one stand-out text that I’ve been most heavily influenced by 
is <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/language-and-the-brain/"  target="_blank"><font color="blue">Sahai and Ageel
(2000)</font></a>. It’s not a good book for beginners, but it’s an excellent book for more advanced readers
who are interested in understanding the mathematics behind ANOVA.
